Its for hardcore fans of their superhero.', u'Post Spiderman, most of the superhero are shown in the light of Emotional, vulnerable & in Gray shades. ', u'This really affected fan base who really look for 1st slide to last spectacular action & not back story.', u'Not just this even Daniel Craig kind of James Bond movies hit bottom ~ failed to impress audience. ', u'It is important not to drag movie with screenplay upto sub 2-hours, but more mind blowing action.', u'But I liked the movie the way it is - 5*
Theatrical cut: 3/5', u'Ultimate Cut: 4/5.
the only things I didn't like about this film was how rushed Doomsday screen time was and Jesse Eisenberg was not a good fit to play the role of Lex Luthor but other than that that Dawn if Justice was a good DC film
It's mediocre Level, There wasn't much Speciality going with half of the film, the beginning was super quick and just added scenes that took 5 seconds, I enjoyed the actors, I suppose they are suitable for the character, In some cases all the elements were not bad and does show a lot of effort into the excitements of all liability of the film, How Isn't Batman V Superman is the coolest thing to ever been seen? God only Knows like we do too, So I shouldn't be using the word only... Where was I? Oh Alright They shouldn't have added the CGI Monsters, That's what ruins the ending for all of us, Maybe it would be better if Lex Luther Build his suit and in to destroy batman and superman together... That would be much much better. I had a good time with the film, I recommend that it was a lot of fun seeing Batman V Superman Fight Together, When Ben Affleck plays batman instead of Bale And Henry Cavill keeps his character mode.", u'Grade: C+
Cinematic comic book masterpiece. Epic beyond imagination. The movie is a bit dark. But the battle is awesome between bats and superman. Having seen every single comic movie out there this movie stands out among the best.
Not as bad as some would have you believe. Affleck was suprising in his role, Cavil seemed to play by numbers for Clark Kent. Starts great with concerns over how much leverage super types can be given, especially when their work is destructive on a large scale, but then it throws all that concern away and ends with catastrophie anyhow. A terrible social message to send about chaos being inevitable in any discussion. But if we don't think too much about the narrative concerns, then it's worth your time... even despite the corny Freudian overtones.
La mejor del a\xf1o, sin duda alguna
POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF 2016 IS HERE AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT'S......okay. This movie is a disappointment but disappointing doesn't mean bad. The main problem with this movie is the narrative and how it was edited together. Instead of a flowing movie, it felt more like a collection of scenes. Somewhere deep within that hodgepodge of scenes however, is a great movie. Instead we just got a decent flick.
I expected so much more. Disappointing.
What's with all the positive response? Zack has officially ruined DCEU by killing off the most important character SUPERMAN without earning his death!
