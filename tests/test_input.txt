Didn't suck but not the best installment.
Was not very happy with the movie. They wasted the chance to make one of Marvels best villians shine
The movie was beautiful it truly pulled the franchise together
this movie sounds exciting
This was by far my favorite X-Men movie by Bryan singer. I loved how everything from the past movies came together, and it collides with the actual comic books now. It's a new generation of X-Men, and I'm excited to see how the future can hold its glory.
X-Men: Apocalypse is an over-the-top superhero film that's entertaining but not very substantive. When an ancient and powerful mutant is resurrected from the ruins of an Egyptian pyramid he puts together a group of follows to help him conquer the world, and when Magneto falls under his thrall Mystique seeks out Xavier to help rescue him. Several new/original trilogy characters are re-introduced, including Storm, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Nightcrawler. However, this kind of further muddles up the X-Men continuity. Yet there are a few interesting character developments, and some intriguing changes in the new timeline. And, the special effects are especially good and bring a lot of energy and excitement to the action scenes. While it's definitely one of the weaker entries of the series, X-Men: Apocalypse is still a fun sci-fi/adventure film.
I enjoyed it with the kids....definitely movie size screen made it better
Great Movie - Go see it the heck with the reviews
Not the greatest to come out of the X-Men films, and unfortunately, a disappointment since Days of Future Past gave this film a new timeline to explore new environments and new characters! Some cool scenes and tension save this movie from being as bad as X3!
Good...but not amazing!
Awesome movie !! Exciting to watch.
Standard X-men movie with some great moments fails to make us care about the stakes
So many plot holes, cheesy dialogue and flaws! They made Oscar Isaac a wooden actor! I didn't know that was possible.
Very good movie, but not great movie. Worth going to a theater to see the action on a big screen, but not likely something you will be wanting to shell out cash to see over and over in theaters.
This movie had funny moments, and a haunting villain. It manages to pull off an entertaining sequel.
While it offers some great sequences, you kind of feel like you've seen this before. The only really new thing is the Quicksilver scene, which was just pure joy. I wouldn't call it better than Civil War, but it's miles better than Batman v Superman.
Good Marvel movie. Nice characters, and quick silver was awesome. Highly recommended. Days of the future past was better, tough.
Like the reviews say, it's pretty disappointing. Feels like they used every cheesy gimmick of the previous collected X-Men films and barely bothered developing any of the new characters. Isaac did his best with Apocalypse but the character still lacked a lot of the mystique and authority of the comic version. None of the characters really made any sense in the X-Men movie storyline let alone the comic one. Good things, Fassbender was one of the highlights as usual (mainly because his character is so tragic), and Quicksilver stole the show with the tiny bit of screen time his intro occupied. Oh, and the small final scene is an awesome treat for all the 90's X-Men nerds.
Great addition to the franchise
Too much going on, and too many characters.
Days of the Past was light years better. Don't get me wrong; I liked this movie. I felt that it was going away from the comic. For example, Storm was never one of the Four Horsemen in the comic books with Apocalypse. Who carries this movie is Quicksilver! Boy, he was hilarious.
I'll give it this....at least it was better than Batman vs Superman.
Great special effects. great story line....different than the comics...but the movies have created their own universe of sorts. I enjoyed it putting aside the difference in story line. Alot of action scenes & some of the "feels" randomly thrown in here & there.
Bit slow at first, quicksilver is the best thing in the movie. Great ending.
Awesome. Can't go wrong with Marvel or DC movies. Bringing my childhood comic books to life. Can't wait for next movie.
even though some people got over sensitive about a billboard, the movie is worth seeing if you like these types of movies.
The movie was great, only problem was it didn't stick to the comic story line like it should have.
X-Men: Apocalypse still a great movie in The X-Men Franchice, full with action and visually stunning, but it's also having a generic storyline, and also a clich\xe9d villain that isn't as good as many villain have to be, though it is better than X-Men: The Last Stand.
In all honesty, as far as a pure X-Men adaptation goes, this is the movie that, in many ways, I've been waiting for. My favorite films in the franchise are still Deadpool, DOFP, and First Class, but this is a close Fourth (along with X2), and is probably the most loyal in terms of giving each X-Man present his or her deserved amount of screen time (aside from Psylocke and Archangel, but at least they did SOME cool things). As a huge fan of the X-Men comics, I must say that some of the earlier X-Men films that garnered a lot of recognition (such as X-Men and X2), though fine films, are not the best adaptations of their source. In these films, too much focus is placed on Wolverine, while many other popular mutants are thrown to the wayside. On top of that, the earlier X-Men films lack brilliants colors and high stakes battle scenes that are present in both the comics and the new Apocalypse film. Now, I don't want it to seem as though I'm bashing the first two films in the original X-Men trilogy, as they are fantastic trendsetters. Still, comic book movies should be made, first and foremost, for the fans. Make a great film, but don't neglect the source material. A large part of me still wants to see the X-Men film property go to the MCU, but this film gave me a little more faith in the strength of this franchise. As of now, I prefer the new X-Men trilogy (First Class, DOFP, and Apocalypse) to the first trilogy (X-Men, X2, and The Last Stand). If you, like me, are looking for a high stakes X-Men movie that really showcases the camaraderie and fantastical battles from the comics, you will very likely enjoy this movie. Regardless of the critics' reviews, this X-Men fan here approves of Apocalypse. Still, maybe we could give the MCU a couple more of Fox's X-Men? Even if it's just Deadpool and Wolverine...? Just a thought...
Thought it was great - Exactly what it is supposed to be. Oscar Isaac was excellent in the role. One of the better X-men sagas
The film was not the best in the X-Men series but still a must watch. It gives an introduction into some of the main characters we see in the first few X-Men movies. Personally I thought Oscar Isaac was fantastic as the villain Apocalypse.
What's not to love about X-Men? No complaints here.
Exciting at the beginning, but lost in the middle.
i have seen this movie and its the best movie i have ever seen 11/10 from me!!!
Usual over the top explosions and face smashing. No acting ability by anyone. Cornball show.
Best comic movie this year
A long awaited closing of the latest X-Men trilogy, Apocalypse is entertaining, visually stunning and violent addition to the franchise, but yet it fails to reach the brilliance of Days of Future Past or the delightful level of entertainment provided by First Class. Surprisingly predictable, with much action and less content, Apocalypse delivers the pop-corn entertainment that every summer blockbuster is expected to do, but fails to deliver the content which made the first two installments formidable movies. ', u'When the first and most powerful mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakes after thousands of years of sleep, the mankind\'s faith seems endangered. With the powers of all mutants he has "consumed" he is aiming at restoring his empire and destroying the people who refuse to acknowledge his reign. He quickly gathers his "Four riders of Apocalypse" and it is only Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and his young team of talented mutants who can stop Apocalypse. Bolstered by stunning visual effects and breath-taking action sequences, Bryan Singer\'s delivery provides what it promises in terms of action.', u"Unfortunately, in terms of a story it is weaker than both Days of Future Past and First Class. There are two reasons for this. The first one is that the main evil character, Apocalypse is somehow not that convincing. This is valid especially if compared to the overall feeling of hopelessness that made Days of Future Past such a classic. The second reason is the predictability. Magneto's role (Michael Fassbender) in the whole movie is too predictable and halfway through the movie you will sort out everything and what is supposed to be a climax in the end of the story, will be just matching your expectations without adding up anything to the tension level. ", u'Nevertheless, X-Men: Apocalypse is still a spectacular summer entertainment that deserves to be seen in the theaters. Beautifully shot, starring beloved and talented actors, it offers what any X-Men or superhero fan wants even if it never reaches the level of its predecessors.
Not as good as the rest but it is a good movie to watch.
Better then the reviews lead you to believe, just wish this trilogy would have left someone else handle it other then Bryan Singer. First Class was awesome, but then Singer got his hands on them, & consistency was destroyed. If your an Xmen fan, I recommend seeing it, just to see how the stories play out, & most of the acting is good, even if the story lacks.
Not a movie the superhero genre really needed at this point. Plays like an episode and probably presented incorrectly. Set in 1983, we already know the X-Men won this one since present day movies have already come and gone. Why not present the sotry this way? narrated by a teaching Professor X to a class of students who then go out and win some other battle? Actor who plays Qucksilver has star presence and should get his own film.
I enjoyed some arcs and some of the seeds planted. But I think I enjoyed Days of future past more -
Although this movie certainly does not live up to its predecessor, X-Men: Apocalypse is a great time all around, especially if you're bored or lonely. Worth a watch
Another movie the critics got wrong. Mainly because they don't care about the context of the movie. If they complain about the costumes, then I'll give them that. However, this movie is so much better and well written than any movie on the market and deserves a much better rating.", u'You know the official well paid critics are corrupt when they say something like, "I was almost rooting for Trump" referring to hatred of mutants and the need stop their immigration. - quote from Rolling Stones Magazine. If Rottentomatoes or any similar source allowed the audience to silence/block these corrupt critics, then they would lose all their funding or stop being so fucking corrupt and actually review it with an unbiased view point.
Apocalypse: Everything they've built will fall! And from the ashes of their world, we'll build a better one!", u'X-Men: Apocalypse feels like an afterthought. After the very successful and pretty good Days of Future Past, director Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg drop everything that made their last film function as a narrative in turn for a woefully edited and flat experience for most of the runtime. Where this film shows flashes of really strong material in the first act with signature character moments put on by talented actors with Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy and younger talents like Evan Peters or Sophie Turner, the story runs from one scene to the next without giving enough attention to its characters or its storytelling.
there were discrepancies with character strengths but overall it was a fun film and I liked it afterwards also, so I'd say it was worth seeing
Great movie. While its plot and villain don't have the same thematic heft as Days of Future Past, and it does feel a little overlong in parts, it still delivers a thrilling story with great visual effects, solid direction and good performances from its cast, especially Turner, Sheridan, Fassbender and McAvoy. One of the most positive aspects of the film was yet another exciting and hilarious Quicksilver slow-mo sequence.
The conclusion to a trilogy that ran out of gas halfway through it's last feature. Any X-Men films to come will have a difficult time standing on such weak foundations. Talented actors and top-notch effects abound, but the bigger this movie tries to get, the more hollow it ultimately feels.
the time has come to stop babysitting Magneto's inner child. the will he or won't he in every movie is draining. i think this series has run its course
I had high hopes on this one , does not benchmark with the previous chapters .
This entry into an extremely long running franchise may not be as good as X2,Days Of Future Past or First Class but X-Men:Apocalypse still have it's moments which are making this movie really entertaining ride even if it's not a best ending for,otherwise,amazing trilogy (First Class,Days Of Future Past,Apocalypse)
The Apocalypse: The moral behind the story of this mutant was that he\xc2\xa0wanted\xc2\xa0to take over the entire world. To wipe out &\xc2\xa0erase all mankind; everything & to start again from scratch. The Four\xc2\xa0Horsemen\xc2\xa0that he gave more power- I feel that he\xc2\xa0really didn\'t. He gave them the power and\xc2\xa0strength\xc2\xa0that they always had\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa0within and he just\xc2\xa0tapped\xc2\xa0into it for them. They prevailed. All 4 of them prevailed! They conquered\xc2\xa0AGAINST\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0apocalypse. They\xc2\xa0proved that they were strong.\xc2\xa0The main\xc2\xa0and ultimate goal of all the X-Men films is simple: to tap into the power that you already have inside of you & to unleash its full power and potential WHEN NEEDED! This was sort of a back story at times because it\xc2\xa0demonstrated\xc2\xa0how\xc2\xa0Cyclops and Jean met; there was a scene with Wolverine and how he met Jean; how Storm came to be a student at the Gifted School and how Peter\xc2\xa0strives\xc2\xa0to fight for his family and\xc2\xa0how\xc2\xa0his power would\xc2\xa0always\xc2\xa0lead him to his father, but never caught up to him even though he is fast but is never there to catch him in time.\xc2\xa0Seeing Raven is always a good thing. She is the center of these films because she fights for\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0is right and\xc2\xa0for needs to be fought for- and not against.\xc2\xa0The character of Jean was essential in the film- the way that she believed in herself and her abilities\xc2\xa0to take down the\xc2\xa0most powerful of powerful and how the entire team came together\xc2\xa0to defeat "The End" was mind-blowing and\xc2\xa0she blew...She soared! She blew! She aimed and she fired! With passion! Flawless scene! The character of Magneto was epic because his power was the most valuable, but Apocalypse tried to corrupt his mind & use it for good as he did with the\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa03 horsemen, but Professor but\xc2\xa0Xavier got to him and\xc2\xa0made him\xc2\xa0realize\xc2\xa0along with Raven that\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0he\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0doing\xc2\xa0was wrong. He\xc2\xa0is strong- strong enough to\xc2\xa0prevail\xc2\xa0against what he\xc2\xa0was being\xc2\xa0manipulated\xc2\xa0into doing. At first, he nixes\xc2\xa0Charles\' ideals and goes to Apocalypse\'s\xc2\xa0plans because of what he suffered and went through but in life, that is what makes us strong- what he went through. There were jokes by almost every cast member or facial expressions that were funny.\xc2\xa0Like\xc2\xa0I always said and\xc2\xa0believe- adding a bit of humor in any film is always a good attribute.
I really enjoyed this movie. It was nice to see further exploration of Magneto's backstory to understand his motivations as an antagonist (not a villain). The new cast members were delightful and had good chemistry with the other X-Men: First Class/ Days of Future Past cast members. Quicksilver had the best scene, in the same vein as the one in Days of Future Past. SPOILERY: Also, Jean Grey is amazing and that powerful in the comics. That wasn't just a plot device of the film to win.
Perhaps the villain is too powerful and too big to be credible, and too dumb at times, but it's still a greatly enjoyable install of the mutant franchise :)
The X-Men movies now bore me
An entertaining third installment in the X-Men First Class series. It has its moments but sometimes feels overwhelming with everything that's going on. If you're looking for a fun and entertaining time, go see it.
X Men Apocalypse was by far 1 of Marvel's best I really enjoyed it...will see again
2.5* What is with these third installments in the X-Men Franchise? Something went terribly wrong...again. Compared to its two predecessors it feels like a huge mess - despite the fact that it starts off really well!', u"Loved Michael Fassbender. That man never disappoints... he has screen presence to die for, despite the fact that his character Magneto didn't get the emotional depth it deserves. The intention was there, the idea of his development might have been brilliant, but the bonding between the audience and Magneto feels harsh...and most of the time, it doesn't work. If it wasn't for Fassbender, it might not have felt a thing. Good performances from James McAvoy, Evan Peters and Jennifer Lawrence as well.", u"I think the movie's biggest problem is, that it has too much going on. It's messy and confusing, jumping from one scene to another without logic. It wasn't as dreadful as Batman vs. Superman, but still not good. It could have been so much more...", u'What bothered me as well was the movie\'s villain. Incredibly cartoonish, stupid and laughably weak. I couldn\'t take him seriously. He was good for a few laugh-out-loud-moments, the rest of the movie it was more like "WTF?!?". Bad, bad villain.', u'On the plus side, the movie was much fun. The action was mixed. Not as loud and awfully long as in Batman vs. Superman, but also not as well dosed as in Captain America: Civil War. The special effects was a mixed bag. There were times when it felt like a video game and other times it was awesome. The pacing was awkward. Most of its troubles are too be blamed both on the directors and writers. ', u'Bottom line: In the end, I would say unless you are a big fan of The X-Men, you should skip seeing this at theaters. It was not bad enough to kill the franchise, but it was disappointing, especially when you can see its possibilities all throughout the movie...
The X-Men movies seem to be cramming too many main characters into the screen time, which seems to take away from the overall plot; and to add on to that 'Apocalypse' isn't nearly as entertaining as 'Days of Future Past.'
Decent characters, true to their comics for the most part to keep the fan boys happy. Some changes but not too bad. A good plot but not as good as previous movies.', u'It was fun.
Good movie with a few suspenseful moments but still your typical X-Men movie.
Its for hardcore fans of their superhero.', u'Post Spiderman, most of the superhero are shown in the light of Emotional, vulnerable & in Gray shades. ', u'This really affected fan base who really look for 1st slide to last spectacular action & not back story.', u'Not just this even Daniel Craig kind of James Bond movies hit bottom ~ failed to impress audience. ', u'It is important not to drag movie with screenplay upto sub 2-hours, but more mind blowing action.', u'But I liked the movie the way it is - 5*
Theatrical cut: 3/5', u'Ultimate Cut: 4/5.
the only things I didn't like about this film was how rushed Doomsday screen time was and Jesse Eisenberg was not a good fit to play the role of Lex Luthor but other than that that Dawn if Justice was a good DC film
It's mediocre Level, There wasn't much Speciality going with half of the film, the beginning was super quick and just added scenes that took 5 seconds, I enjoyed the actors, I suppose they are suitable for the character, In some cases all the elements were not bad and does show a lot of effort into the excitements of all liability of the film, How Isn't Batman V Superman is the coolest thing to ever been seen? God only Knows like we do too, So I shouldn't be using the word only... Where was I? Oh Alright They shouldn't have added the CGI Monsters, That's what ruins the ending for all of us, Maybe it would be better if Lex Luther Build his suit and in to destroy batman and superman together... That would be much much better. I had a good time with the film, I recommend that it was a lot of fun seeing Batman V Superman Fight Together, When Ben Affleck plays batman instead of Bale And Henry Cavill keeps his character mode.", u'Grade: C+
Cinematic comic book masterpiece. Epic beyond imagination. The movie is a bit dark. But the battle is awesome between bats and superman. Having seen every single comic movie out there this movie stands out among the best.
Not as bad as some would have you believe. Affleck was suprising in his role, Cavil seemed to play by numbers for Clark Kent. Starts great with concerns over how much leverage super types can be given, especially when their work is destructive on a large scale, but then it throws all that concern away and ends with catastrophie anyhow. A terrible social message to send about chaos being inevitable in any discussion. But if we don't think too much about the narrative concerns, then it's worth your time... even despite the corny Freudian overtones.
POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF 2016 IS HERE AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT'S......okay. This movie is a disappointment but disappointing doesn't mean bad. The main problem with this movie is the narrative and how it was edited together. Instead of a flowing movie, it felt more like a collection of scenes. Somewhere deep within that hodgepodge of scenes however, is a great movie. Instead we just got a decent flick.
I expected so much more. Disappointing.
What's with all the positive response? Zack has officially ruined DCEU by killing off the most important character SUPERMAN without earning his death!
Horrible! I had so much anticipation for this film. This was not only one big let down but was possibly one of the worst films I've seen all year. The film is so depressing, batman and Superman are idiots fighting each other for stupid reasons unlike the comic, and Jesse Eisenberg's performance as Lex Luther was so awkward to watch much like Jim Carry as the Riddler from Batman Forever.
Yeah I'm giving it a 5. Really underrated but had a lot of good (when a say good a say excellent-Christopher Nolan good) and bad (like bat nips bad). For example Ben Affleck was amazing as batman and Bruce Wayne but doomsday was shitty as hell. Gal Gadot was awe inspiring as wonder woman (that rock metal was radical when she appeared) but Jessie Eisenberg was mediocre as Riddler,,,I mean Joker... I mean Mark Zukerberg,..I mean Lex Luthor Jr (yeah I know he didnt actually play Lex) All in all I didnt like it but you have to compensate for these one star reviews, the story was thought provoking and the action was breathtaking More like a 4 but you know Henry Cavill has nice abs and Gal Gadots Hot so why not give it a 5.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is in my opinion a pretty good superhero film. It has really good performances by Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Jeremy Irons and Gal Gadot, but Jesse Eisenberg was completely miscast as Lex Luthor. It has well written dialogue in the screenplay by Chris Terrio, although there were some scenes I felt could either be left out or explained more. It also has an amazing score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL and Zack Snyder brings this film to life with his fantastic visual style.
This turned out to be the shit show it thought it would be. In all honesty, Affleck was maybe the best part of this whole fiasco. Why WB continues to entrust the future of this series to Snyder is beyond me. A dumb script, dour tone, and really misplaced as far as where a story like this should take place in the DC movie universe. This is not how you start. And 2 hours of supposed dramatic tension culminates in probably one of the dumbest scenes i have ever seen. One plus was Wonder Woman, though she was underused.
Greatest comic book movie ever.
Damn batman v superman back at it again woth 1 and a half stars
While it had a lot of potential, Batman V Superman divulges into a sloppy script and story in an obviously rushed attempt to start a Justice League franchise(just take that amazingly lazy Justice League cameo e-mail as an example of that).
Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice proves to the Audiences that DC Extended Universe is the best, though they still have to learn from Marvel. It still great movie, with a great thrilling action sequences, great performances from the casts, especially for Ben Affleck and Jesse Eisenberg, and also great visual effects, though it's too much conflict, darker tone storyline (Maybe DC wants to be darker than Marvel) and also a little anticlimax in the end, but it still good enough.
I don't know it's good or not.
Batman v Superman truely missed the mark. There are some great stuff here; action scenes, visuals, Alfred and Wonder Woman. Affleck is servicable and much better than early predictions, but he still has a long way to go. Eisenberg as Luthor is an enormous dividing factor, since despite a fresh take on the character, it barely resembles anything about the diabolical businessman. The script however is beyond poorly written and the terrible editing doesn't help either. Motivations are often not clear, many scenes seem out of order, and various story points are incredibly uninspired and convenient. BVS is still an enjoyable ride -specially in IMAX-, but it is nevertheless a dissapointment. 6.5/10
Batman Vs Superman is pretty self explanatory, lots of fighting, more fighting and even more fighting. But it delivers, the shots of the hand on hand combat between the bat and the god are incredible (no spoilers). But there is too much fighting. The movie tended to focus more on setting up for a future installment and forgot to be a good stand alone movie. The effects are stunning, cinematography; 9/10, but the problem i really had with this movie, is the plot. There is too much going on and the story and script are not delivered in a good fashion. Overall Batman Vs Superman was a little bland, but entertaining. If you prefer a classic, comedic, superhero Vs supervillain adventure, this movie probably won\'t peak your interest. But if you prefer a dark, emotional, "save the world" thriller, it may be right up your alley.
I feel like I'm the only one that loves this movie. I thought it had an intriguing story to it, amazing action, and the best batman EVER! It wasn't the most action packed of the other superhero movies but it was still good. Jessie eisenberg was amazing as lex Luthor. The only thing I didn't like is that it seemed that the ending had even more destruction than the first, and that I'm pretty sure batman kills in his movie (batman doesn't kill). I think that this movie was good and enjoyable.
Very dry story and just a build up to Justice League. Lex Luther was horrible, the story should end after the Batman and Superman Fight. Doomsday was a waste of time and unnecessary.
Very interesting movie though very long and takes long to get interesting but a good movie overall. i'd give it 70%
I honestly went in wanting to like this movie thinking "eh, I usually don\'t agree with critics," but they were right. It just wasn\'t fun. You think that\'s what a superhero movie should be, right? Nope. It doesn\'t even deliver plot-wise either because it has many plot holes and weird plot devices (I\'m looking at you, Martha). Superman returns this time imitating a lifeless block of wood, while Batman and Wonder Woman deliver a great performance. The visuals are fantastic, however. Probably beats most Marvel movies (if not all). The action is just...meh. The movie wasn\'t fun because it didn\'t have those great moments that other superhero movies have. Like the quicksilver scene from Apocalypse and Spiderman in Civil War. Wonder Woman comes close but never delivers. I wouldn\'t recommend this movie.
Fail, fail, fail...', u'This movie paints two of the greatest superheroes as naive fools and offers no reason for a battle to occur.
appalling at the most, I am a huge fan of both superman and batman and I am disappointed with the killer bat and bad affeck acting. rotten to the core. guess I'll stick with marvel, I never liked marvel but at least the movies are enjoyable and not flat out dumb! listen to the fans we are the ones willing to see the movie twice or more. cast who you like but dont expect fans to go more than once. I personally saw star wars 3 times, why? because it was good!
Movies is good The problem is some people they don't understand the story at all
The biggest slap to the face for Superman fans. Follow Batman as you learn about his origin(again), why he needs to stop superman, how he obtains kryptonite, sees all his visions, how he meets all of the other superheroes, saves Superman's mother, and so much more. And follow Superman as he.. randomly saves people and... gets himself kill by Doomsday. Superman never even says one word to Wonder Woman. Movie falls into catering only to Batman fans. ", u"The movie itself is ok. Didn't dislike this movie as much as other people did. As long as you can piece together the randomness that this movie is. This movie gets a 2 1/2 stars, because overall it isn't about Superman vs. Batman, but the story of how Batman defeats Superman.
ok Movie, Biggest downfall was Lex Luthor.
This movie was everything I expected and more. The build up to the greatest gladiator match in the history of the world was amazing. The fight was a stunning visual performance for Batman and Superman. Ben Affleck was the Batman I've been waiting for a darker, more brutal Batman. Can we talk about Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman for one second oh my god, she was made for this role, she stole the show during the fight with doomsday
First of all lets get out in the open anyone who said that Ben Affleck couldn't play a good Batman(including myself) we should say sorry He nailed it.Now to the movie it starts off way to slow infact they don't get going to about half way into the movie.Their was way to much Lois Lane in this movie I swear she was in more scenes then Batman or Superman. I also didn't care for the Younger Lex Luther they should have casted an older actor and why did they make him act like the Joker so much.I liked Wonder woman but she could have been in it longer. The Fight scenes were good no beef there. I don't think Doomsday should have popped up until the next movie. The movie was alright not great DC comics are way behind Marvel and have alot to learn about making Comic Book movies.One last thing That Suicide Squad dosen't look all that great either so DC has alot of catching up to do!
It's a very non fun movie with not a lot of humor and the humor in the movie is very bad when you see a movie you usually want to have fun but this movie is no fun but the only good part of the movie is mostly Batman and a little wonder woman and the worst characters are superman and lex Luther
54%', u"Zack Snyder's tonally well-realized interpretation of the classic comic book characters has some stunning visual grasp, but the rest of the film is cluttered with indulgent set pieces, repetitive, one-note dialogue, and shoehorned reminders of DC's franchise plans.", u'V: 61%
As a batman fan I was impressed with Ben Affleck's performance. Story needed a little more depth but all and all a pretty decent and fairly entertaining feature.", u'Side Note: Hated Lex Luther and wish Doomsday was left out or better integrated into the story.
i like to review movies as they are; movies. I had a ton of fun at the movies but it does not mean it is by any means a good movie. 2 hours before the action begins? wut?
It was a cool movie. Its just my expectation for this movie was so high. I wannit to see a better film then it is. The trailer is much better then the movie.
It may not have been the greatest superhero movie of all time like everyone hoped, but it was far from being a bad movie. The biggest let down was the uninteresting battle against doomsday at the end.
Filled with comic book lore that may not resonate with most viewers, but Succeeds with great performances from newcomers Ben Affleck (Batman) and Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), though it fails miserably through Story and Character Development.
doomsday looked dumb not even doomsday more like general zod 2.0 lex luther wasnt that evil wonder woman wasnt hot enough she has no boobs,ass or face.and batman kills people not cool and mercy graves died
Poor plot, story line, character development and fight sequences. And Ben Affleck as the Dark night? What?!
Not as bad as the critic reviews make it out to be, but far from perfect as well. This second installment falls short of setting up the DC Extended Universe. A thin script is mostly to fault for this misfire. Ben Affleck, however, becomes the best Batman/Bruce Wayne we have seen on the big screen. Storyline can be jumbled at times. In comparison to Marvel's Civil War, the one thing Dawn of Justice lacked was the storytelling experience we have come to love with each Marvel installment. Not a bar film, but should have been better.
Thought this is going to be a lot worse movie than it is. It is way too long movie but you can see Ben playing role that he is going to be remembered by and doing it well. Movie has flaws that you can say but plot is very good and it gradually rises. You can see that Batman is fighting angrily and showing us some rage and Jesse playing role of Lex is so great. 78/100
brilliant cinematic comic book movie that finally shows us the dark twisted batman we deserve
Some things to like. I was actually one of the few people who believed Ben Affleck could pull off a good performance in Batman, and he was really really good in this role. Also, like all of Zack Snyder's films, the action and visuals are just breath taking. They seem pretty kick@$$. What lacks, and this tends to be a problem with most of his films, the story and characters could have been worked better. We see why Batman hates Superman but theres not much reason for Superman to hate Batman. The story is clunky, Eisenberg plays a very cartoonish Lex Luthor and his plan wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. Plus, Doomsday is a combination of the DNA of Zod and Luthor? That was the same with Nuclear Man. WTF Snyder?!
great movie not difficult to follow.. like other people said... \xf0~? waiting for justice league.
This Movie Was Crap!
very good but very anticipated ending
I think this is an amazing film, I really don't know what is wrong with people judging movies believing they are movie critics when they don't know nothing about movies. It was an incredible Hall of Justice Debut. Stop comparing with Marvel and finally understand that the movie theme for DC Comics is deeper and darker than others super heroes movies. 5 stars for David, Chris, Zack and Nolan as EP..Love it!!
Did not care one bit for Doomsday\'s "origin". Don\'t think the screenwriters of this flick have ever cracked open a single comic book by the plot of this.
great movie for fans
Movie was entertaining and had you going til the end....Affleck did well despite all the haters out there...I had a good laugh at the end with the depiction of small town America but then Hollywood rarely gets stuff like that right...All in all a decent flick!
Terrible premise with an annoying villain.
I've learned my lesson from Man of Steel, and this came as no surprise after how underwhelming which this turned out to be!", u"For starters, director Zack Snyder has clearly proven here that he's unable to tell a nice flowing cohesive story. You can say that it's David S Goyer's fault for creating this mess, and I completely agree, but the director is partially to blame for how this was also delivered. He tried with Watchmen, and to give him some credit, I admire him for staying true to the source material. As for Man of Steel, oh boy......good old Snyder made this in such a way that made it appear to be a huge staple to his legacy! He not only wanted me, but the rest of the general public to love this film. A major comeback for one of the greatest superheroes of all time, LOL! Him and the writers assumed that we are really that stupid to allow them to rewrite the character at the expense of basic common sense! What a douchebag! After all the mistakes that they've made with the film, the studio executives decided to be a bunch of cowards, and tell them to go along the same route. Boom! Surprise! This is what they shoved out, and here is what we ended up with!", u'The movie has such a big ego, it tries to beat the general public over our heads with wanting us to love it! It takes itself so seriously, and so dark to the point where they never bothered to ask themselves, "Umm, shouldn\'t we be a little lighthearted and have some fun with what we are working with?" Studio executives, "Don\'t you dare ask us such relevant questions again! Dammit, we must be different from Marvel!" Ugh, for the love of God, you fools! LISTEN TO US!', u"How can anyone not understand that Warner Bros is beyond desperate to compete with Marvel!? Haven't they ever heard of these two simple words, SELF RESTRAINT!?
Awesome action pact great fight scenes I laughed I cried go see this film don't take really young children
It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.
Well this was probably the most bloated and messy movie I have ever seen.
I really enjoyed it. I don't know what all the hate was about. I loved Ben Afleck as Batman. I wasn't sure he was going to be that good but overall really enjoyed it.
a real let down, would've preferred a back story to lex luther at the beginning rather than seeing bruce waynes parents die for the millionth time.
I loved it, IMAX 3D was AMAZING the fights came at us and the plot was great people said it was crap but they were wrong.
It was not as good as Man of Steel. I loved Man of Steel. Good movie though, I'm writing this a month after seeing it and I don't have feelings of wanting to watch it again, nor feelings of wanting to bash it with the herd.
Can't wait until the next movie to come out. Comic nerd !! LOL
Biggest superhero movie up-to-date live up to the hype in every way we can imagine. Too bad we've had so many others before...
The film makes you think it's going to be a formulaic third act but reveals its going to be much more. It juggles so many characters while also being thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. The character work is just amazing. Every character gets a moment, every character shines. The airport fight scene is probably the best fight scene I've seen in years. The story is very well crafted, with amazing action. This is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen, and I don't know how the Russo Brothers are going to top this (hopefully, they can).
Unlike batman v superman, this movie shows a reason why they are fighting. The Airport battle is AMAZING!
Awesome completion action pact
Best Captain America movie I've seen so far
Spider-man though, soooo funny.
It's very good never wanted it to stop
Best movie in 2016 easily. I wish they focus more on the relationship between Steve Rogers and Bucky more. But the movie still did a great job on why Bucky was so important to Steve. Every Characters in this movie made sense and no one felt like they were there just because they are part of the marvel universe and needs to be there to make people happy. Overall Amazing movie.
God I love this movie in fact this might be the best marvel cinematic universe it was definitely worth the wait the acting is good Spider-Man and black panther stole the the characters were devolved pretty good and I can't wait for black panther movie and Spider-Man homecoming
Not a fan of captain America movies but this one was amazing,spider man was awesome and ant-man too I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of captain America and iron man
I won't ruin it by giving away spoilers but I will say that this was a great comicbook movie! I don't know if its better then the two Avenger movies but its close. The Action was good the plot was good the introduction to Spiderman and Black Panther was very strong. Finally they pick the right person to play Spiderman. As for Black Panther they made him look real strong so that the causal fan will now be very interested in his solo movie which done right could be great. I thought the whole cast worked real hard into making this movie good so if your into comicbook movies and you were disappointed with Batman vs Superman Civil War goes above and beyond to make your forget all about it! One last side note Not only did it crush Batman vs Superman but it also was better then Deadpool as well I know fans might try to say otherwise but its simply not true
Vengeance is a dish best served Marvel!
Great! Managed to fit in a lot gracefully
More of the same, but quality. More of an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie. You might question some of the motives of the characters but you will certainly be amazed by how many stories and feelings the movie is able to cover and capture. No one's story or arc felt half-drawn.
I think this movie is just the best MCU Movie of all time.
This newest install meant to the marvel cinematic universe (MCR)
This is now my favorite movie of all time, nuff said
The Cap movies are the only MCU that are consistently great standing on their own...
The core of the conflict was abandoned 30min in. The director seemed to regret creating too powerful of a being in Vision as his role was reduced to minimal in order to not end the war before the hour. Things did get pulled together somewhat towards the end. An entertaining watch overall.
Good but also just more of the same. All these Marvel movies are blurring into one at the moment.
I'm Not Giving this movie 5 out of 5 stars because one part of the film came out slow, But it got so much better with all those superheroes choosing which team to go on, I Also Love How They Did A First Scene Before Marvel Studios, I Don't Know Why They Do That... But I'm Very Happy i saw this movie, I wanted to see it thinking it will be one of the best superhero movies ever made, And Yes It Is, Even Better than Avengers: Age of Ultron.", u"Everybody go watch this movie because you will all the time you need before walking in the theatres and experiencing a cinematic marvel Amazement, I'm not even kidding you will have fun with this movie, There were a lot of funny moments from spiderman and people thought he is the best character, he is really cool and have damn laughable humour, Don't Miss This One", u'Grade: A-
If people didn't LOVE this, something is wrong with them!! THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!! It's tied for my favourite movie of all time!
Very nicely done! I just disagree with who they chose to play spiderman and disagree that Tony Stark helped spiderman with his suit and all because that did not happen in the comics. The guy that plays spiderman is just too young.
A reminder that Disney\'s "The Avengers" was not a fluke and that every bit matters from the actors, the stories, and the teams behind the cameras. Civil War accomplishes what so many big budget action films don\'t. It intelligently entertains.', u'These characters have motivation and purpose. The script is was written by those who paid attention to what the characters would want to do, and the story is woven deep within that concept. The Disney Move Machine is in top form with obvious love being given to every detail from those behind and in front of the camera.', u'I detailed synopsis is not required. If you have even the slightest interest in this genre you will enjoy it immensely.
Great stuff when it concentrates on the intellectual aspect of the conflict. Maylays at an airport are all "Saturday morning cartoon" fare but the real fight comes toward the end when friends lay into each other over loyalties and nobody is a clear cut winner. Not better than Winter Soldier, but well worth anyone\'s attention. Consummate acting and directing, a big jump from the days of 1990\'s rubber suits and boring villains.
Probably Marvel's finest production. Stellar direction, stellar cast, stellar movie.
EXCELLENT!!! ESPECIALLY IN 3D!!!!
This movie lives up to the hype and goes beyond it. This is probably the best Marvel film to date and possibly the greatest comic book movie of all time. The airport scene alone is worth the price of admission. Any worries you had going into this film just forget about them. The only problem that could be had with this film is the main villain's arc but he isn't in the movie enough for it to take you out of the film. I could on and on about how awesome this movie is but I'll just end this by saying.....GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
One of my least favorite of the amazing Marvel universe movies. Spider-Man cg was awful in the midst of cg that didn't look cg. So most of the cg was amazing then you get an almost Pixar like Spider-Man. I'm still hooked on the Marvel universe and this still progresses the sorry well, but a slight disappointment compared to the rest.
same thing, different sequel.
very enjoyable, I'd see it again
It was okay. 90 % is getting REALLY carried away. I loved CA2 winter soldier btw.
Marvel certainly has their formula down. Though it's one that has become too predictable and boring in my opinion. Also, why the hell didn't they give Vision (a true artificial intelligence that has the ability to bend matter) more lines, more story etc.? He's one, if not THE most intelligent and most powerful character on Earth (if not the galaxy). For the writers and director to have you believe an AI would simply sit in the background not doing anything for the majority of the film is fuckin stupid.
Wow. The movie was greater than I ever had imagined it to be. That character of Vision who is Stark's ally is just such\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0character\xc2\xa0like\xc2\xa0Tony. He really says\xc2\xa0some\xc2\xa0of the most\xc2\xa0outrageous\xc2\xa0things. His humor matches that of Stark's. That is for sure! Downey, Jr. ALWAYS adds his own brand of humor in these Marvel films & I love that about him! Laughter is good- in any sort of a\xc2\xa0movie\xc2\xa0no matter the genre!", u"There really wasn't much of a war\xc2\xa0brewing\xc2\xa0between the characters of\xc2\xa0Captain America and Iron man.\xc2\xa0They\xc2\xa0both did not\xc2\xa0see eye-to-eye on things. The\xc2\xa0same\xc2\xa0situation can occur in life\xc2\xa0today. People will not agree on everything; but it is the tactful way in which to handle things & Captain America\xc2\xa0handled\xc2\xa0them in a\xc2\xa0respectable\xc2\xa0manner fighting for what he wants\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0believes\xc2\xa0was true whereas Iron man just\xc2\xa0wanted\xc2\xa0to fight- literally to stop the Captain.\xc2\xa0And what happened? A War!", u'Someone realized\xc2\xa0their\xc2\xa0mistake and apologized. I will not say who- but once that happened, another secret is\xc2\xa0revealed\xc2\xa0and that\xc2\xa0opened\xc2\xa0up another way between the two, but in\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0end, the same\xc2\xa0things\xc2\xa0happened- someone apologized. In\xc2\xa0life,\xc2\xa0people\xc2\xa0will realize the truths that they are meant\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0realize\xc2\xa0and see.\xc2\xa0You cannot force\xc2\xa0truths\xc2\xa0onto\xc2\xa0people\xc2\xa0who\xc2\xa0are not in the proper mindset to see it when\xc2\xa0you want\xc2\xa0them to see it, but when they choose to see it in\xc2\xa0THEIR\xc2\xa0own\xc2\xa0time. That is what I pulled from the confrontation\xc2\xa0between Steve and Tony during the film.\xc2\xa0I love\xc2\xa0seeing The Black Widow kick butt! Scarlett is one might\xc2\xa0feisty\xc2\xa0bad-ass to put it mildly. I love her\xc2\xa0attitude, her pose, her control,\xc2\xa0her everything! The film had stellar acting, flawless action scenes and there was never a dull moment.\xc2\xa0The\xc2\xa0movie was explosive and that is putting it accurately! Lol! Scarlet Witch really added that "flare" to the film!\xc2\xa0The young actor who portrayed the role of Spider Man was very comical for the short time he was on screen. It was\xc2\xa0just\xc2\xa0hilarious\xc2\xa0to see that and for the character of Aunt\xc2\xa0May played by Tomei; I agree with\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0Tony said, his aunt\xc2\xa0is too hot to be an Aunt! Lol! Paul Rudd as Ant-Man added more humor.
Another great marvel movie.
Marvel Studio's does it again, with what I think is probably the best Marvel Film to date. Captain America; Civil War is a hit and jammed packed full of action from start to finish. highly recommended seeing this Movie. Well Done, action nonstop, and tons of Marvel Heros to like.
Stupid... So... So... Stupid.
Amazing movie. Entertaining to the max with a good story, great characters, fun comedy, and unbelievable action. ', u'SPOILERS', u"I really liked how the movie went in directions that I wasn't expecting. After the big battle I thought they were going to make up and be friends again to team up against the other 5 Winter Soldiers. But the bad guy's plan was way better. Restarted the Civil War, and had the movie end with them still apart, setting up future movies", u"it's really amazing that we live in an age where we can have a movie with all these different superheroes in it, and not only does it look real but it's also really good", u"While I was watching it I was wondering who would be on which side, and the only ones I thought I knew where Iron Man and Captain America, but they ended up being on the opposite side of what I thought. But they both made perfect sense. Captain America went through the same stuff with Hydra and SHIELD. It makes sense that he doesn't trust bureaucrats and politicians to make decisions. And Iron Man's side makes sense given past movies and how he feels guilty and responsible for so much stuff. It may not have been addressed a lot in this movie but it has been in previous movies.", u"So many good characters, and I don't just mean awesome superheroes. I mean the actual characters, and their development and archs.", u"I really liked everything about the introduction of Spider-Man including the actor. I am now super excited to see the new movie. And it was reaffirmed to me that Spider-Man is my favorite superhero because I was just so excited to see him, even over all these other awesome superheroes. would have been amazing if I didn't know he was in it. But I didn't know about anyone other than captain, Iron Man, Spider-Man. I was guessing it would have Falcon and War Machine, I didn't know it had everyone else, especially Black Panther and Ant-Man. Black panther is bad-ass and Ant-Man was awesomer and funnier than he was in the entire Ant-Man movie. (4 viewings)
this movie was off the charts awesome i love it
Great in depth story , better action scenes to compliment the already compelling story arc with a few suprising plot twists from about mid-movie towards the final moments of the film . Great post-credit scenes which connect CW (Civil War) to upcoming Marvel movies . There are brief moments when it may seem like the movie has some cheesy humor however ,', u'All in all , a great film to watch especially for those fans of the comic book universe as we see great icons clash together in this epic film . The best Captain America film by far . I personally , watched the entire movie 5 times , the most I have done for any film . Great watch !
My review is skewed by seeing the ratings before hand, so I only saw the good in this movie. But it was quite good, nonetheless (unlike the dark knight rises). Good political plot (almost typical now - heros save the world, world overreacts, heros castrated, bad guys cause problems, heros save the day again). But how each character tied in, was very well co-ordinated. A+ One of the few hero movies that does suck.
8.0 on 10.', u'This is a must see movie for any super hero film fan. Action packed, 2 and a half hours of great distraction. ', u'Not to be missed.', u'Recommended 100
While Batman v. Superman flopped harder than a kid at his first diving lessons, Civil War satisfies superhero movie fans with its action, its wit, and its believable storyline.', u"It would have to take something drastic to split the Avengers. The storyline of Civil War follows Earth's Mightiest Heroes as they are conflicted over whether the Avengers should have to answer to anyone or should be free to intervene whenever they deem necessary. I hate to see heroes fighting against each other, but the Russo brothers make the action so fun and the dialogue so witty that I'm actually left wanting a little more.", u'Civil War is a solid installment in the Avengers franchise, and the Russo brothers have proven themselves to be, for lack of better words, quite awesome at making superhero movies.
Wow! Best Marvel movie of the year so far!! Action packed!!..
I'm very sad to say this movie was disappointing, especially sense my favorite character/actor is in it (Robert). It wasn't very funny, and felt like a repeat of Winter Soldier.
With the Marvel universe expanding so hugely it is very hard to say whether Captain American: Civil War is the best movie released so far, but it is certainly among the top deliveries from the Marvel/Disney's franchise. Darker, raw, action-packed and with the typical glimpses of fresh humor, the third installment of the Captain America spin-off is also a thought provoking movie which somehow partially escapes from the typical Avengers -extravaganza.", u'As it could be expected, after two Avengers movies, Captain America: Civil War is directly related to the whole Marvel-universe. With no extraterrestrial threat to the world the group of super-heroes if focused on fighting secret organizations and villains. Logically, operating around the world soon evokes questions of responsibility and accountability for the whole team. An issue that causes the split of the whole team. Forced to accept obeying to international rules or be considered outlaws, the Avengers have to take hard decisions and that results in Captain America (Chris Evans) refusing to play according to the international rules. Split in two groups, pressured by bureaucracy and fighting an untraceable enemy, the two groups of Avengers are facing the biggest challenge coming from within. ', u"Talking about accountability, we should say that this theme is actually Civil War's biggest asset. Almost everyone among the viewers has wondered at least once in his time watching Marvel movies, to whom are these heroes accountable? To what kind of rules do they have to obey? Who defines what is allowed and what is not? All these thought-provoking questions are carefully asked by directors Anthony & Joe Russo. By depicting the choices each of the Avengers makes, they directing duo explores also the different aspects of the terms responsibility, accountability and checks & balances. This makes Captain America: Civil War a different Marvel movie, one that is darker, more serious and still pleasantly tensed. Needless to say, the humor elements are also part of the story, but this time they are mostly provided by the newcomers in the Avengers univers: Ant-man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-man (Tom Holland). Both of them are refreshingly funny and blend excellently amidst the overall darker tonality. ", u'In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is probably among the top 5 best movies from the Marvel-Avengers universe. Carefully blending the typical old-school touch of Captain America, with the big and noisy kitsch of The Avengers, this installment explores provoking themes and asks questions which you keep you intrigued and entertained throughout the whole 146 minutes.
a little slow at first, and some plot holes upon review, but still a fun Marvel movie (and way better than all the Thor movies)
This movie was the best movie in the world
Movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise have always been good. Some reached the five-star level (Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy), others just reached 4 1/2 stars. But this superhero landmark film is the next big thing. It's make up everything that Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice got wrong. Captain America: Civil War is not just your typical superhero movie, it's an all new generation of heroes. Civil War is probably not just the best Captain America movie, it's the best MCU movie yet.", u'Taking place after the events or Avengers: Age of Ultron. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Played by the amazing Chris Evans again), is working with his own Avengers team to stop evil doings. But the result leaves with more explosions and casualties. The Secretary of State (William Hurt), and the United Nations think it would be better if the Avengers could help save the world when they want them to help. Rogers disagrees and thinks that the Avengers should be free to defend the world without government interference, but Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., who will always be the perfect Iron Man), agrees with the Secretary of State. Let the battle begin.', u"Civil War feels like a third Avengers movie, but with no Thor or Hulk to bring more excitement to it. But that's ok. Thanks to the amazing directing of the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who directed the previous installment, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and an amazing story by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who stayed with the franchise since Captain America: The First Avenger, have brought this movie to life and added some very dramatic depth to it.", u"It's Team Cap Vs Team Iron Man. You pick one. On The Captain's side is the marvelous Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen),the awesome Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the arrow-shooting Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and the hilarious and lovable Ant-Man (a never-better Paul Rudd). On Team Iron Man, he's got help from the beautiful and strong Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), his friend War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and our brand new friendly neighborhood Spider-Man (a perfect performance by Tom Holland. Thanks to Holland, Spider-Man in this movie is way better than Andrew Garfield's two Spider-Man movies, but it's not close to topping Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man, yet.", u"We also got a new recruit on Iron Man's team. This hero deserves more praise than some heroes and his name is Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman in his best role to date after 42 and Get on Up), a.k.a T'Challa. T'Challa has a problem with Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier, (a perfect Sebastian Stan), the Captain's best friend who was brainwashed by the movie's infamous villian Zemo (Daniel Bruhl, who is coming back after his should've been Oscar-nominated performance in Rush). Steve wants Bucky to be free but Tony will stop at nothing to kill Bucky. It's one of the superhero movies you really need to see. ", u"Thanks to the Russo Brothers, Markus, and McFeely, Civil War will remain as MCU's best for a long time. That is until all four of them finish shooting the two-part Avengers: Infinity War movies, which is said to have a total of 68 characters. But until that day comes, Captain America: Civil War will blow people right out of their seats and leaving the theater with something that will stick in their heads for a while. Civil War one of the movies this year that you'll have fun watching.
Marvel outdid themselves.
well this was damn cool except for a few things...killed off some cool people way too fast! Black Panther best character in the whole movie! Antman still awesome! definitely check it out for sure!
Captain America: Civil War handles its stuffed-to-the-limit package superbly, combining excellent writing, thrilling action, and a surprising amount of emotional heft to create a nearly perfect superhero film.
Great film! Marvel and Disney does it again. Top 5 superhero movie of all-time! Amazing fight scenes. Fantastic pacing and arguably the best character balancing of all of the mash-up super hero movies to date. Every character got their time to shine and respective story arc. Excluding, Jeremy Renner's Nighthawk who was obviously there only to fun-fill his contact with Marvel and have an even number on each side for the big battle royal at the airport. They accomplished so much between so many different characters without confusing the audience that it sets the bar a bit higher for future mashup movies.", u'The only reason I give this a 4.5(9/10) is because I still do like care for Bucky as an actor and I do not buy into the relationship him and Captain have. I am not a big Captain fan in the first place and it makes me sad that he is soon to take over the mantle for future films.(Speculation and rumors. Not confirmed) Also, a nice surprise is how enjoyable the black panther character is. I believe he will provide a fresh new feel moving forward considering he is not an American and his abilities are tied to a family lineage which is unique in this cinematic universe so far. This is a must see and if you can make it I encourage you to see it in theater for the full effect.
From the preview, I didn't really expect much from this movie. When I saw it, I absolutely loved it. One of the best MCU this far!
I'll admit, I really wasn't excited for this one. Marvel movies were starting to get overbearing with films like Age of Ultron and Ant-Man (which was at least a fun movie). No, this movie was fun, had a decent plot, and didn't require you to have to read a year's worth of comic books to understand the characters, as well as their morals.
This is easily one of the most well-executed films that successfully balances an incredibly large cast of characters while still giving them each their time to shine and each have their motivation fleshed out.
Another great Marvel to add to the series. What makes this movie great is how it is a genuinely fun time. Many movies now get bogged down in being 'dark' and this movie is able to have its dark moments but still leaves you with the feel good vibes that a comic book movie should. ", u'All the actors deliver spectacular performances in the rolls they have become so accustomed to playing. The two most surprising performances come from Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) as they both deliver two of the funnier sets of dialogue. ', u"There are two post-credit scenes for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet. These are not too critical to the story, but do give you another smile before you leave the theater.
This was a fantastic movie! Not as good as the first Avengers, but a close second!
Overrall, a very good action-superhero movie, but i cannot give it a perfect 5 stars because i hate the grainy-style that the action scenes are filmed in.
The first was better!! *drops mic*
Light hearted and fun with a lot of nods to the cartoon. if you are a fan of the show then you will enjoy the ', u'movie . I went in expecting goofball type fun and got exactly what I expected. Had a good time over all.
Overall TMNT: Out of the Shadows was a enjoyable movie to take my kids to see. I think the developers and marketing overestimated the age range they are to tap into, as my 4 and 7 year old were dying to see it and it was rated PG-13 when it felt very PG in reality. ', u'The Turtles appeal to a younger demographicI would say ages 4-10 and if the makers were going for a nostalgia trip for older fans these are not the Turtles you are looking for anyhow.', u'Otherwise it was action packed and funny and a good representation of what the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are as a franchise. Not a terrible movie to go see with the kids.
On the one hand, it's pretty bad. The dialogue is speech after speech about how the next piece was figured out (wow, if I out this tube in it will instantly tell me about the aliens and how the world will crash down). It's bad. Pretty darn bad. Unbelievably bad.", u"On the other hand. They did keep it moving and the action and visuals in parts were fun to watch. Also, it's hard to not love the turtles' personalities.
Better than the first one!
Very fun and entertaining. In alot of ways its better than the first, it captures more of the 90's tone.
No doubt that is a lot better than the first one. A lot of fun but not enough Krang and not enough martial arts fights.
Worser than the first
This is the best one as far as I'm concerned! Great special effects in the 3D version and the turtles themselves are more interesting. The story line does take from some other adventure movies and the love story bores me. Nonetheless, I had fun!
Lacked the enjoyment and theatrics of the first one, felt a bit forced...not a bad movie, definitely not a good one though
A very enjoyable movie with a many problems
So Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 was overall a definitive improvement on the first film which was a disaster, still not a good film, but you can actually get a few moments of entertainment out of this film. First thing's first... if you did not like the tones, humour, or characters of the first movie, not much has changed, so there's a good chance you won't respond to this much more than the other. But some improvements have been made meaning that at this rate maybe in 12 years we will get a TMNT movie that captured the tones of the cartoon perfectly. There is a little more of a focus on the turtles in this film, either that or there was a little less of the April O'Neil. The chemistry between the turtles was a tad better, there was a dash of that fun campy humour here and there and a few moments where you can have a good laugh. Where this film crashes and burns however is with how they handle the plot and the many new characters.", u"The turtles in this film at times really delved into that darker more serious rendition from the first film but overall they had a slightly more lighter tone in this film, cracking a few more jokes and showed some pretty decent and amusing chemistry. The best parts of this movie (yes there are good parts) were when it was focusing predominantly on the turtles, none of the other side characters apart from Casey Jones and maybe Will Arnett's character really made a huge positive impact on the film. The human cast was mostly very meh, Megan Fox was just being the hot chick friend, Will Arnett was cashing in his paycheque, Tyler Perry was a crazy Neil deGrasse Tyson and uh.... Shredder was just there. Stephen Amell as Casey Jones was a great addition to the film, and probably the only one, he had a lot of character and charisma and was quite amusing. One or two moments he gets caught up in the silly humour, but overall the Arrow star elevates this film any chance he gets. ", u"But the real garbage in this film were the villains, but also the plot. It is very unfocused, messy, and falls back on the same tropes as the first film and pretty much every transformers film... Seriously, it was like Deja Vu for the 10th damn time. And man was this film busay, the plot holes were real, it was like when this film got put on the chopping board someone went absolutely ham on this thing. Entire scenes connecting two events felt missing and it didn't flow very well overall. And the way this film ends was like Paramount needed to wrap things up and get started on Transformers 9, so they finished everything in 5 minutes and moved on. Very rushed and not well thought through. ", u"Seriously though, introducing Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang and bringing back Shredder all in the same film was a huge mistake because the film just didn't know who to focus on as the villain and so no-one actually had enough screen time or development to be an interesting villain. Bebop and Rocksteady were introduced well and i was really digging their characters, but post-transformation they mostly became the device used for fart jokes and dumb humour. Shredder was about as useful in this film as those buttons on your jean pockets you never use, such a shame. And Krang, well he was most definitely an afterthought here, just thrown in the film as a device to get the main plot moving. Having no strong and entertaining villain really stuffed this film over and it could have been considered a good film if it had even one. ", u"So Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 isn't a good film, but there are some improvements upon the first film that when added together do let you enjoy parts of this film. It does have a lot of problems with their villains and the massive jumps in plot progression and unexplained conveniences but the good aspects such as parts of the humour manage to keep the film afloat. You should know by now whether it is for you or not, so enter at your own risk. ", u'5.5/10
i think this was alot funnier than the first one. i enjoyed watching this more.
Overall this movie was far more superior than the previous tmnt movie, and was quite enjoyable.
This one is bad. I love the first film. Shredder is worthless. Krangs voice sucks, turtles don't fight, Bad Casey Jones.
I think it's great! Very entertaining and I love the characters.
Cheesy most of the time almost breaking pg:13 barrier
This is definitely cowabunga
Fun and brainless summer action!
Just another original classic of entertainment history thrown in the mind of Michael Bay
I loved this Ninja Turtles animated show when I was younger but this film certainly didn't live up to that. It came off far too young and the story was stupid and boring at times. I love the turtles but that's about it with this movie
"Surprisingly a big improvement over the 2014 reboot, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" is more snappier and faithful to the original comics and cartoons."', u'Movie Review: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: ', u'Out of the Shadows', u'Date Viewed: June 4 2016', u'Directed By Dave Green (Earth to Echo)', u'Screenplay By Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec, Based on characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird', u'Starring: Megan Fox, Stephen Amell, Will Arnett, Pete Ploszek, Jeremy Howard, Alan Ritchson, Noel Fisher, Tyler Perry, Brian Tee,', u'Stephen "Sheamus" Farrelly, Gary Anthony Williams, Brittany Ishibashi and Laura Linney.', u'Featuring the voices of Tony Shalhoub and Brad Garrett', u'Those green, pizza-loving ninja turtles are back and the surprising result is that "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" is a big improvement over the 2014 reboot from two years ago. It\'s more snappier and faithful to the original comics and cartoons but since this movie is produced by Michael Bay, it is just as loud and overblown as his three "Transformers" sequels. Not only does "TMNT: OOTS" feature not one, not two, not three, not four but FIVE VILLAINS! The filmmakers also brought along three-time Oscar nominee Laura Linney and Tyler Perry for the summer ride as well. Linney handles her role as a NYC police chief like an old pro but Perry goes way over the top in his role as a mad scientist who helps the Shredder in defeating the turtles.', u'The one thing I found totally inappropriate about "TMNT: OOTS" is Megan Fox and her school girl fetish-wear. I know she\'s supposed to be a reporter doing undercover work but come on Michael Bay, undercover in slutty Britney Spears mode! Nevertheless, the action is better and thankfully there is little turtle-flirting going on compared to the first one. The plot revolves around the Turtles, Leonardo (Pete Ploszek), Raphael (Alan Ritchson), Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) and Donatello (Jeremy Howard) dealing with the return of the Foot Clan and their arch nemesis the Shredder (Brian Tee) who has escaped from prison along with two dimwitted criminals, Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (WWE\'s Stephen "Sheamus" Farrelly). ', u'With help from the Foot and his new accomplice, TCRI scientist Dr. Baxter Stockman (Perry), Shredder later transforms Bebop and Rocksteady into giant animal mutants. The turtles still fight crime in secret so that allowed former cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) to take all the credit in defeating the Shredder. Also thrown into the mix are news reporter and Turtles ally April O\'Neil (Fox) and Casey Jones (Stephen Amell, from TV\'s "Arrow"), a former corrections officer who quits the force and becomes a hockey-masked vigilante after his boss, police chief Rebecca Vincent (Linney) refuses to believe that he saw four ninja turtles driving a high-tech garbage truck.', u'Meanwhile, the Turtles have an even greater evil waiting in their shells, Shredder also teams up with a brain-shaped octopus known as Dimension X alien warlord Krang (voiced by Brad Garrett). His diabolical plan is to bring his powerful war machine, the Technodrome and use it to destroy all human life on Earth. With Batman, Superman and the Avengers all fighting each other, it is up to the ninja turtles and their human allies to stop Shredder and Krang from taking over the world.', u'As I said before, the action sequences are more competently staged than the first film and there\'s even a few funny moments. When the turtles have to skydive off their jet so they can reach to the cargo plane that holds Bebop and Rocksteady on board, Raphael, who is afraid of heights says "What would Vin Diesel do?". ', u'I don\'t know why Tyler Perry chose to do "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows". How does he go from playing a hot-shot lawyer in David Fincher\'s "Gone Girl" to a mad scientist who has brillant lines such as "Eliminate those Turtles!". Director Dave Green (Earth to Echo) and screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol) capture the kiddie spirit of the cartoons and the early 90\'s live-action movies but this $135 million cash-bang is as brainless as the plot.', u'Bebop and Rocksteady make a good two-villain team in this movie but they\'re stuck with poor material. Even though "TMNT: Out of the Shadows" is rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, it\'s perfectly suited for 10-12 year old boys. It\'s mostly harmless and kind of enjoyable. I\'m not saying I liked this movie what I\'m saying is that I\'m not one of those Turtle-heads who enjoys "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" 24/7.', u'"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" is not a great slice of pizza but there are some flavors you\'ll likely enjoy so at least it wasn\'t as painful as I thought it was going to be.
It's the turtles...loved the action and the depth of the turtles as they go from wanting to be human to understanding who they are.
Yes... I went and saw this. I saw the first one and it was bearable. But this one? No. Terrible. It's all about the visual effects. Forget a decent story. Forget about depth of characters. The whole thing is boring and pointless. The only people I have met who enjoy these seem to be adults who grew up on these comics as kids. Surely they must be disappointed with the way these movies represent their heroes. Give it a miss.
Although the original movies hold a special place in my heart, I do enjoy these new ones.
It was very satisfying. I loved it. It only has one bad word and is one of those movies that can trigger your emotions. For example, you fell sad when characters are sad and feel surprised and suspense. Laugh at the jokes. Stuff like that.
It was pretty decent. I laughed.
Sequels to bad movies are always tough, especially from a business standpoint. Even if your follow-up is notably superior there's a good chance that no one will show up to see it. Audiences are typically afraid to spend money on something that is not a guaranteed entertaining experience and that seems to be the case with the sequel to 2014's forgettable take on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.", u"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is a bigger, better, and more fun sequel that eschews the generic superhero origin baggage of its predecessor and aims to make a brighter and more colorful movie aimed at juvenile audiences. And it succeeds in its limited ambitions, but it fails in becoming anything more and lacks the oomph to make it a true critical or commercial success. Or a particularly great movie. Its greatest strength lies upon the likeability of its main four characters and yes, their interplay with Megan Fox's April O'Neil. When the Turtles are cracking jokes and engaging in playful banter it's fun. When the movie has to advance its non-existent plot it's miserable. There are some new added elements that older fans may love such as Krang and Bebop and Rocksteady doing their Bebop and Rocksteady thing. (Stephen Amell tries to make a good Casey Jones, but he is given nothing to work with, so no dice Arrow fans.) But it's all fairly insubstantial and all the big names and lovely set pieces add up to jack shit. I forgot half the movie already and this is only two days after seeing it, so take from that what you will. In short, it's a passable rental or download title, especially for children, but it still falls short of the 1990 original or even its flawed sequel. Yes the one with Vanilla Ice.
If you've seen the first TMNT movie, then you already know if you'd like this sequel. It's a dumb, fun action movie with a fair few cheap laughs thrown in, and I like that it never really tried to be anything more than that. The plot was a bit like a cheap knock-off of the first Avengers movie, which seemed a bit weird and unnecessary. By no means was this film a classic, but if you have nothing better to do on a lazy weekend and you enjoyed the first film, then it's worth catching.
I enjoyed some of the aspects that they included in the movie with its slapstick humor, but some of the movie became kinda of bland. Overall it's much better than the movie tmnt.
TMNT out of the shadows review', u'After watching "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows," we realize this is yet another bad sequel--adding to the collection of disappointing movies for 2016. Moreover, Dave Green did no justice for this franchise. The movie focused way too much on a subpar storyline, and not enough on the action. The new characters they added (like Tyler Perry playing Baxter Stockmen) were also below average. Honestly, Mr. Perry\'s attempt at acting was more like a big joke the whole movie. Joining the ranks of Mr. Perry, Stephen Amell\'s role as Casey Jones didn\'t compel us, either. (Maybe he should just stick to playing Oliver Queen in Green Arrow?). We were also disappointed with how boring and pathetic Bebop, Rocksteady, and Krang were as the villains.', u"On a more suggestive note, we would've liked to see the dynamic of how intense and furious Leonardo and Raphael can get with each other when they get into it--which is something the fans always love with them. Instead, we were presented with a movie with no climax, that just skated to the end. As a matter of fact, the main battle, featuring The Turtles vs Krang (a moment we were all waiting for), was the most boring, non-crucial moment of action in the movie.", u"Overall, this movie was such a let down, and that's why we give it a bad 4 out of 10.
Great movie for ppl who grew up watching Tmnt
Excellent excellent movie. I ENJOYED it ALOT. :-) I hope they come out with another movie. Turtle fan since I was a little girl. Mikey was ALWAYS my favorite and still is tis this day. Lol.
Yes, another typical of TMNT, some funny- script with some dirty-jokes. This is not a serious movie to watch but at last you spend your 2 hours of time to laugh a few. Maybe it will cheer your one day.', u"Formula.. yes lets talk about Hollywood's formula in this decade. This seems saturated to me but its solely 3 things that Hollywood prioritize nowadays, visual effect, action scheme, and jokes. Yap those 3 things will made some dollars to persist its franchise. Oh my god its coming again in the next year or next two years. Holymackarel, a turtle makes me laugh on and on.", u'Just make sure you follow the movie formula and you got audiences on you. With some risk you could ruin the rating but of course you still got audience no matter what. Hellyeah because its a comic adaptation. It is an audience magnet bro.
A love letter to fans of the original cartoon. Not perfect, but, fun regardless. Fox is still a Fox
Better than the first one. This one was funny, entertaining and a fun date with the kids.
Starts with a bang, but quickly fades away. The turtles were in character (minus Leonardo), and most of the actors were great. I did however feel like Casey Jones was played terribly, and barely ever in character. And overall, the movie was just WAY too childish. It was at least entertaining.
My general rule is: if you're going to see a stupid movie, at least go to a FUN stupid movie, not a boring Michael Bay-produced excuse of a movie. While it is funnier than the original and boasts is a really great setpiece, this movie only offers D-List acting, a horribly written script, and cheesy (no pun intended) effects. Please, spare yourself and watch a better movie.
i used to love these turtles as a teen but watching this movie put me to sleep.. i think something was missing but i'm good
The movie was great although a few jokes were juvenile and silly. I was hoping for a darker tone to the film though it held up, looking forward to a third movie.
Better then part 1 way way way better
The turtles are back and better than ever!!!', u"The turtles are awesome, Casey jones was good, great to see new villains that we had never seen son the big screen before. Bebop and rocksteady are funny and great. Krang was good too, he felt to me a little rushed in, but he was overall great. It was funnier and sillier, which is great because that's how the movie its suppose to be, cartoony. Overall Bette than the first one. TURTLE POWER!!!!
As a ninja turtles fan, it's all you could ask for in a ninja turtles movie! Critics might not enjoy it, but I certainly did! Best tmnt installment since the live action 1990 film, for sure!
can't wait till the next one..
The movie is a smash hit the graphics are incredible. the movie delivers to the fans of the ninja turtle world.
Bebop & Rocksteady. "MY MAN!"
Way better then the first film.
OK, so yesterday I had a day off. Spent the morning celebrating Dad Day with he girls at school, then I had a couple of hours to kill - so I went to see TMNT movie. I needed a to give myself a couple of hours of mindless entertainment. It was AWESOME... yes it's bad acting, too muchCGI, way too much going on, lack of story, and just ridiculously over the top. BUT it was fun. A fun, kinda funny, cool movie to watch. ", u"What I never understand was critic review and ratings.. RT has it at 27% - of course it's not an oscar winning movie, but for what ti's supposed to be - I thought it was good enough.
a lot of action, storyline is ok. the turtles look a lot different from the original movie.
Eye-rolling fart jokes aside, this is a live-action version of the 80s cartoon, which makes me very happy, and all that we really wanted.
It a pretty good,fun movie, sure some parts look like they came from a video game but overall if you want to kill some time and just want to watch a movie i recommend you see it.
Typical Michael Bay formula: CGI-fest, crappy plot, unintelligent humour, unengaging action sequences, slomo Megan Fox in skimpy outfits and big heroes vs. alien invasion showdown in New York City. The only campy fun I could get out from this boring-ass, try-hard cartoonish sequel was, again, Michaelangelo. Although they listened to complaints and demands from the disastrous first instalment, Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady's introductions were highly disappointing and Shredder's practically still shit (at least he has an Asian face now, I guess?).", u"The turtles' personalities remain mostly faithful to the classic adaptations, but their fighting style and decision-making on the other hand... Even black cows crossing the street at night seem more ninja than these huge, loud, silly turtles. Oh right, I almost forgot, they learnt ninjitsu from a book Splinter found from the garbage in the sewers.
best movie ever seen
very good movie would watch again
5.5/10', u"I love the turtles and found myself enjoying every moment the turtles were on screen, but everything else in the film is so bad that it's hard to recommend this film.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows really does try to rebuild a much better film from it's predecessor. This sequel is slightly better and makes a decent sequel. However, the majority of the reception chose to dislike this film while comparing it to the first movie too. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: OUT OF THE SHADOWS - 2.5/5 STARS.
Only 3 Words: Fast, Loud and Funny!
Obviously this movie is terrible, but then again, if you go back and rewatch the original series, it's pretty intolerable to begin with. Having said all that, this movie makes up for everything it fucked up in the last movie! It captures the mood of the 80's cartoon, focuses on the turtles, has genuinely entertaining action sequences, and gives us the characters that Turtles Fans have been begging for on screen for decades! Doesn\xe2??t hold a candle to the original two, but this movie was fucking fun.
Not as good as the first one, but has it's moments. More for Kids but drawn out, lot going on and nothing at the same time. Fun movie, after a ton of jokes some hit the mark.
Not nearly as terrible as I thought it was going to be. Nice to see some other characters in this one.
It's awesome warcraft is finally on big screen. Movie isn't perfect though I enjoyed it very much. 100% recommend everyone to watch it so blizzard will make sequel. There are negative critism on this film but hey this is first film, and story isn't the most crucial of warcraft lore. All is forgiven when story warcraft 3 reign of chaos is much improved film. make that happen blizzard!!
Great to experience this new world on the big screen. I think this is one of those movies that will be even better the second time you watch it.
Fun yet unremarkable film. Filled with shallow characters, top visuals and good action. Get in on bluray.
They did a great job updating the fantasy of the games and bringing it into the cinema. If you liked any part of the series, even the RTS game you will love to movie.
Damn, was not expecting this to be anywhere as good as it was. Amazing cgi and decent human actors carve the way for this years lord of the rings. Definitely big screen worthy even without having played the game it's based on. I'm always partial to a fantasy flick though.
loads of issues, but I had fun.
Warcraft is pretty, the story beats are good, action well made and Duncan Jones does his best to elevate the film, but it's betrayed by some very mixed acting and dialoguem and a story that's so overloaded that sacrifices the emotional aspect for anyone not familiar with the source material (I guess?). It needed to be longer. Better than most game adaptations, but severely flawed.
This was a great start setting the scene for what's to come. The lore and history of warcraft is very extensive and without the proper introduction only avid World of Warcraft players would know what was going on. This was an excellent film with insight into the characters on both sides and not just making out that one side is right and the other evil. It was one of the best Sci-fi fantasy movies I've watched and Iam looking forward to a sequel with anticipation!!
Worst movie of the year. Characters are bland to say the least, badly written, and there is no chemistry between any of them. Script is, I would say nonexistent, and I did grow up on Warcraft 2 and 3, but still I couldn't fallow up on what the hell is going on. And the ending....oh my god the ending makes no sense whatsoever. Also worst CGI I've seen in last ,I don't even know how many years. I remember that Warcraft 3 animations looked better then some characters In this movie...
I wanted to like it. I really did. Warcraft is clearly made with passion for the material, but that's not enough. And while the film makes a sincere effort to 'humanize' the Orcs, by giving them relatable motivations, it all felt too safe and sanitized, to the point that it was hard to care what was happening to anyone. The human characters fared even worse. I was hoping this was another unappreciated gem like John Carter / Edge of Tomorrow / Tomorrowland / Last Witch Hunter, but, no.
It's a generic videogame adaptation that features Game of Thrones music. Or the same composer. It felt like watching a cheap GoT episode.
Surprisingly well developed plot, great graphics and characters that were actually believable. Did not require that you spend the balance of your adolescence I front of the TV playing the video game to understand the storyline.
Easily one of the best movies I've seen in years! ", u"I only started playing WoW a few months ago, and want sure if like this movie much; I mostly went because my wife wanted to. But 'wow' indeed! Beautiful graphics, rich sound (fantastic soundtrack), and solid acting. It never felt too loud or bright, like most JJ Abrams movie do. It kept good pace, yet never felt rushed. Overall it was just a really fun experience!", u'I admittedly know very little about the Warcraft lore. Now, i want to know more! I would love to a sequel of toys very soon.
third grade film of all time....
A good Fantasy movie and the best videogame to movie adaption yet
if you haven't played any of the video games or read the books this movie lacks context. if you have, this movie feels rushed. but keeping in mind the nature of the medium, and within the context of the lore, this movie is a success on every level. I realize that sounds like a lot of caveats, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
Movie wasn't a bad one, and there was some humor in it, despite some not seeming to catch on to wit and sarcasm. I enjoyed it, and it was based off of a backstory to the game, with some differences. It wasn't so much convoluted as it did require some background in the game. To say you had no sense of where you were, though, I do believe Azeroth (the name of the world) was tossed around in there several times to give you that indication. Also, there was that big map on the ceiling that gave you a visual. Not really sure what you're talking about there. Anyhow, despite the lack of marketing and a scrolling 'this is where we are' backstory, I've seen the movie once in standard and once in 3D. It's worth the watch, and is entertaining.", u"So, most of what I've seen in posts from a lot of people is that they didn't really catch on to what was going on in the movie, and felt like it it was only made for the fans of World of Warcraft. Well, kinda, as most of the advertising was done via the World of Warcraft pages and other Blizzard sites - kind of a big marketing failure, in most regards.", u"So, to clarify, this wasn't a World of Warcraft movie, per se, it was actually, as the title suggests, a throwback to the original RTS game 'Warcraft: Orcs vs. Humans.', of which there were 3, with various expansions of the versions.
Warcraft was cheap trope fantasy that made no sense and its first line establishes it as a prequel for more films that should never be made.
This move is like the game and it is amazing it's so good you should go see it
Although it's been three years since I played the game, the sense of nostalgia was high in this one. Each new zone they entered I tried to place. The reveal of Stormwind and Ironforge was great. I can't say much about the authenticity of the plot as it's been a long long time since I played the originals. The only negative I can say is the real life humans didn't really seem right in the CGI movie. Even the clothing was a bit off. Worth watching and I'd see the sequel.
critic at roton tomatoes are stupid. great movie to watch!!!
The movie remained true and authentic to the games characters, landscapes, races and story for the fans of the games to truly appreciate, while also presenting itself to people who are unfamiliar with the game and allowing them to see, follow and be introduced into the amazing universe Blizzard has created. I look forward to any possible sequels or series in the future!
Dunno what the 'critics' are smoking. But it's definitely not weed. From this point on I won't trust these so-called experts. In the audience, I trust. And rightly so. Sure, there are misgivings here and there, especially with a couple of actors lacking performance prep, like not employing consistent accents with dialogue delivery. I understand if, at the beginning, one might feel slightly lost, as the editing may be a bit jittery at the start. Given all these, they do not deter from keeping you entertained as the visuals, plot and story hold everything up. I personally remembered most of the characters and did have an emotional connection - mostly on Durotan and Lothar (somewhat) through the course. BUT! If you're a hardcore loremonger, you'll hiss at some of the changes. Overall, though, if you're a fan of the fantasy genre, this movie is well worth the watch. If you're a fan of the game, you'll definitely enjoy this movie a whole lot more. Score is 3.5 as I'm a gamer - 3 as a fantasy genre fan. Watch it while you still can.
For all I know this movie may be exactly what Warcraft fans wanted, but for me, as a non-fan, the story just seemed generic, hard to follow, and at times even contrived.
I fell asleep about halfway through (seriously) and it wasn't like I was sleep-deprived going in. This was a big jumbled mess of a movie that probably would have been better as a two-part movie - or even a trilogy - that would have allowed some actual character development. It would have at least given the viewer something to care about.
Too much cgi spoiling this well written script.
one of the worst edited, written movies of all time. if you never played the game you will be lost. DO NOT SEE THIS GARBAGE
I am excited and recall many memories
Fast paced and action packed. Never played the game but still enjoyed the movie. Better than I expected.
If you're not familiar with the Warcraft universe, just be open minded and be prepared for things to happen really fast. Be ready to soak in the few precious slow moments of getting to know the characters and feeling the world. If you're a fan of the games, then nothing need to be said - we've been waiting for this for a long time and now it's here and it's glorious. Enjoy and be proud to be a part of it.
for a low budget movie it was pretty amazing. great plot and great action
Pacing issues but very fun movie. Will definitely be seeing it again.
A great film that was worth the wait. I was not sure about the idea of mixing live action and CGI at first but after seeing the film its hard to tell the difference at any point. Still wish this would have been release in IMAX theaters. I feel it would have made it even more epic.
Relatively decent for a video game adaptation. Acting was decent, story was easy to follow (even for non warcraft fans), but, above all, the CGI was very well done, and beautiful to boot. Not a bad watch at all!
This is definitely a movie for the fans of the lore. It likely helped that I have a copy of The Last Guardian from Blizzcon 2008. There were some great references that set this up to where the game itself launched the first expansion which many of us felt was the peak of the game. The layered references were many, and I can easily see how those who have not been engrossed since Orcs vs Humans could have been left feeling bewildered. Yes, I definitely let my geek and a bit of my age just show there.
as someone who has played wow, I really enjoyed this movie and hope to see sequels.
I enjoyed the movie quite a bit and don't understand all the critic hate. I mean I've played wow and hearthstone a bit but I'm no hardcore can.
Never played the game myself, but entertaining to watch as am into whole fantasy action genre. Good CFI effects and I was hooked on the main theme song by Ramjn Djawadi!! Lol me and movie soundtracks
Awesome movie, I've no idea why it'sgetting bad reviews. I fyou like fantasy genre this movie will please.Excellent seamless blend of CGI and live action. A goody story about honor and learning to get along with others.
A great great movie. Loved every minute. Never played the game.
WARCRAFT doesn't tread into condemnable territory, but it's underdeveloped characters and convoluted conflicts keep an attachment for what's happening on the screen from being formed.
My knowledge of Blizzard\'s Warcraft video game franchise is very limited, but I\'ve always been aware of its style, gameplay, and popularity since it first appeared on the scene. The only installment I\'ve played was "Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness" nearly 20 years ago. I thought it was well made and fun, but had no desire to follow the franchise any further. When MMO RPG "World of Warcraft" launched online back in 2004, the series exploded in greater popularity and changed video games for an entire generation.', u"Of course, these days whenever a preexisting property gains mainstream attention, Hollywood wants to make a movie or better yet a franchise out of it and after many delays, Warcraft is now a big budget blockbuster. Other than Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider, and Silent Hill (not their sequels), movies based on video games have been poor to say the least. Even my guilty pleasure franchise, Resident Evil, doesn't scream: quality adaptation. So can Warcraft launch a new era of video game movies? Not completely.", u'Warcraft seems to have just as much going against it as it does going for it. The world is vast and interesting, but not thoroughly explored. The characters are colorful and diverse, but not very fleshed out. The story is epic and compelling, but poorly structured and paced.', u'One thing that holds up throughout however is the visuals. Whereas Lord of the Rings had a more realistic gritty style, Warcraft has a vibrant and colorful look that never gets too cartoony. The orcs, animals, and magic effects all look great and gives the film a standout style.', u'The main problem Warcraft has is its lack of narrative depth. Much like "Batman v Superman" earlier this year, Warcraft was clearly butchered in the editing room. Certain story and character arcs feel totally disjointed and rushed because so much material seems to have been cut for time. I felt like I was watching two movies on fast forward. Too much happens too fast and the characters aren\'t given the chance to make a strong connection with the audience outside of a couple of orc warriors. And the casting is questionable to say the least.', u"Warcraft is definitely not a great movie, but it's not a terrible one either. It is worth a look, but don't expect Tolkien-esc quality fantasy. I may not care to ever see another Captain America or Pacific Rim movie, but I'm definitely open to another Warcraft and hopefully things can be improved in future films (IF there will ever be another one).", u'Oh, and the entire final act is RETARDED', u'Score: 5/10
Very enjoyable throughout. Some base knowledge in the game lore helps, but isn't required to enjoy it. Nearly everything in the movie that would possibly confuse people is explained either visually (read: context) or through exposition. The 2 things I was worried about initially was how they would mesh the scenes with orcs and humans together, and that the trailers didn't really show a good sense of the human acting. The movie deals with both of these issues really well, and my previous doubts in those 2 areas were for naught.
I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It wasn't the greatest movie ever but it was interesting and had me wanting to see what happens next. Clearly there's meant to be a part two. I hope it happens.
Can\xb4t cover everything in so little time, but overall the changes were for good and for coherence reasons given that not everything can be explained. Liked it very much.
loved it .. just found it a bit confusing ... old lore
Biased given I played a lot of Warcraft back in the day - hope there is a part 2 and they tie it much closer to the game. Would've love to see Arthas / Frostmourne.
Awesome! Very masterful artwork! Blizzard at its best.
It was a fun movie but this is mainly for hardcore fantasy lovers and fans of the game. You average movie audience will quickly find themselves a little confused by both plot and characters.
A little tough to follow if you never played the game, I kept finding myself wondering, "I wonder if this happened in the game"? Still, aside from some cartoonish magical effects and a couple of really sad scenes, I thought it was a fun flick worth watching and I certainly enjoyed it.
I was really looking forward to this one. It turned out to be a huge CGI mess, with a bad storyline and awful character development.
The critics are way off on this one. Great movie. loved it!
Really enjoyed this movie. Definitely met my expectation.
Played the games, loved the movie.
I very much enjoyed this movie. Though not a hardcore fan in any sense, I have played WoW on and off for many years and I think that is what made this enjoyable. It did not feel like a movie about a specific character but about the history of a world. I can understand feeling lost if you were not had not played the game but it was a fun experience for me.
I liked the movie, I think a big issue with many critics is that many outlets advertised a movie not so much based on the game but the lore and a fresh story even comparing it to a mix of avatar and lord of the rings. But, the movie was based very closely to the MMO, even though the timeline was before World of Warcraft, the timeline did fall within the Warcraft Strategy/RPG games of which World of Warcraft drew its lore and story. I have played the game and I do love fantasy/science fiction, and thought this was good movie, with excellent eye candy, but will agree the acting of the human side, besides Fimmel, who did well, was a bit bland and well, boring.
Some great call outs for the fans, but too much CGI to make the actors playing the humans to feel comfortable. It's a good start, and has made a ton of money globally for a video game movie. But there's a long way to go for this gaming juggernaut to be accepted as solid movie franchise.", u'The "Human" actors all feel out of place. But it\'s that way for all the humans, which is why I point to the tremendous amount of CG set pieces (either that or, dare I say, some less than stellar directing) that tripped them up.', u"Due to the success of this film in China I wouldn't be surprised if the sequel panders to them with Pandarians. Western audiences might just sit this entire video game movie adaption series out while the East (always East ) gets to enjoy a series made just for them.", u'The lore of this universe would be better told with an animated series rather than a big budget movie.', u"The movie was good, but it should not have been what it is. In a time where practical effects are being blended far more seamlessly with CGI this movie comes up short and leaves western audiences wondering why they don't love this movie because they just can't quite figure it out as they get in the car and go home talking about their favorite moments...and how they won't be buying the Blu-ray and will probably hold off seeing the sequel.
This was off the hook....\xf0???
Had a great time watching this movie!
I never got into the game but seeing this film it really peek my interest, it's a very good film one of the best films based on video games in recent years.
