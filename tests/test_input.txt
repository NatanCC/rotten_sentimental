Didn't suck but not the best installment.
Was not very happy with the movie. They wasted the chance to make one of Marvels best villians shine
The movie was beautiful it truly pulled the franchise together
this movie sounds exciting
This was by far my favorite X-Men movie by Bryan singer. I loved how everything from the past movies came together, and it collides with the actual comic books now. It's a new generation of X-Men, and I'm excited to see how the future can hold its glory.
X-Men: Apocalypse is an over-the-top superhero film that's entertaining but not very substantive. When an ancient and powerful mutant is resurrected from the ruins of an Egyptian pyramid he puts together a group of follows to help him conquer the world, and when Magneto falls under his thrall Mystique seeks out Xavier to help rescue him. Several new/original trilogy characters are re-introduced, including Storm, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Nightcrawler. However, this kind of further muddles up the X-Men continuity. Yet there are a few interesting character developments, and some intriguing changes in the new timeline. And, the special effects are especially good and bring a lot of energy and excitement to the action scenes. While it's definitely one of the weaker entries of the series, X-Men: Apocalypse is still a fun sci-fi/adventure film.
I enjoyed it with the kids....definitely movie size screen made it better
Great Movie - Go see it the heck with the reviews
Not the greatest to come out of the X-Men films, and unfortunately, a disappointment since Days of Future Past gave this film a new timeline to explore new environments and new characters! Some cool scenes and tension save this movie from being as bad as X3!
Good...but not amazing!
Awesome movie !! Exciting to watch.
Standard X-men movie with some great moments fails to make us care about the stakes
So many plot holes, cheesy dialogue and flaws! They made Oscar Isaac a wooden actor! I didn't know that was possible.
Very good movie, but not great movie. Worth going to a theater to see the action on a big screen, but not likely something you will be wanting to shell out cash to see over and over in theaters.
This movie had funny moments, and a haunting villain. It manages to pull off an entertaining sequel.
While it offers some great sequences, you kind of feel like you've seen this before. The only really new thing is the Quicksilver scene, which was just pure joy. I wouldn't call it better than Civil War, but it's miles better than Batman v Superman.
Good Marvel movie. Nice characters, and quick silver was awesome. Highly recommended. Days of the future past was better, tough.
Like the reviews say, it's pretty disappointing. Feels like they used every cheesy gimmick of the previous collected X-Men films and barely bothered developing any of the new characters. Isaac did his best with Apocalypse but the character still lacked a lot of the mystique and authority of the comic version. None of the characters really made any sense in the X-Men movie storyline let alone the comic one. Good things, Fassbender was one of the highlights as usual (mainly because his character is so tragic), and Quicksilver stole the show with the tiny bit of screen time his intro occupied. Oh, and the small final scene is an awesome treat for all the 90's X-Men nerds.
Great addition to the franchise
Too much going on, and too many characters.
Days of the Past was light years better. Don't get me wrong; I liked this movie. I felt that it was going away from the comic. For example, Storm was never one of the Four Horsemen in the comic books with Apocalypse. Who carries this movie is Quicksilver! Boy, he was hilarious.
I'll give it this....at least it was better than Batman vs Superman.
Great special effects. great story line....different than the comics...but the movies have created their own universe of sorts. I enjoyed it putting aside the difference in story line. Alot of action scenes & some of the "feels" randomly thrown in here & there.
Bit slow at first, quicksilver is the best thing in the movie. Great ending.
Awesome. Can't go wrong with Marvel or DC movies. Bringing my childhood comic books to life. Can't wait for next movie.
even though some people got over sensitive about a billboard, the movie is worth seeing if you like these types of movies.
The movie was great, only problem was it didn't stick to the comic story line like it should have.
X-Men: Apocalypse still a great movie in The X-Men Franchice, full with action and visually stunning, but it's also having a generic storyline, and also a clich\xe9d villain that isn't as good as many villain have to be, though it is better than X-Men: The Last Stand.
In all honesty, as far as a pure X-Men adaptation goes, this is the movie that, in many ways, I've been waiting for. My favorite films in the franchise are still Deadpool, DOFP, and First Class, but this is a close Fourth (along with X2), and is probably the most loyal in terms of giving each X-Man present his or her deserved amount of screen time (aside from Psylocke and Archangel, but at least they did SOME cool things). As a huge fan of the X-Men comics, I must say that some of the earlier X-Men films that garnered a lot of recognition (such as X-Men and X2), though fine films, are not the best adaptations of their source. In these films, too much focus is placed on Wolverine, while many other popular mutants are thrown to the wayside. On top of that, the earlier X-Men films lack brilliants colors and high stakes battle scenes that are present in both the comics and the new Apocalypse film. Now, I don't want it to seem as though I'm bashing the first two films in the original X-Men trilogy, as they are fantastic trendsetters. Still, comic book movies should be made, first and foremost, for the fans. Make a great film, but don't neglect the source material. A large part of me still wants to see the X-Men film property go to the MCU, but this film gave me a little more faith in the strength of this franchise. As of now, I prefer the new X-Men trilogy (First Class, DOFP, and Apocalypse) to the first trilogy (X-Men, X2, and The Last Stand). If you, like me, are looking for a high stakes X-Men movie that really showcases the camaraderie and fantastical battles from the comics, you will very likely enjoy this movie. Regardless of the critics' reviews, this X-Men fan here approves of Apocalypse. Still, maybe we could give the MCU a couple more of Fox's X-Men? Even if it's just Deadpool and Wolverine...? Just a thought...
Thought it was great - Exactly what it is supposed to be. Oscar Isaac was excellent in the role. One of the better X-men sagas
The film was not the best in the X-Men series but still a must watch. It gives an introduction into some of the main characters we see in the first few X-Men movies. Personally I thought Oscar Isaac was fantastic as the villain Apocalypse.
What's not to love about X-Men? No complaints here.
Exciting at the beginning, but lost in the middle.
i have seen this movie and its the best movie i have ever seen 11/10 from me!!!
Usual over the top explosions and face smashing. No acting ability by anyone. Cornball show.
Best comic movie this year
A long awaited closing of the latest X-Men trilogy, Apocalypse is entertaining, visually stunning and violent addition to the franchise, but yet it fails to reach the brilliance of Days of Future Past or the delightful level of entertainment provided by First Class. Surprisingly predictable, with much action and less content, Apocalypse delivers the pop-corn entertainment that every summer blockbuster is expected to do, but fails to deliver the content which made the first two installments formidable movies. ', u'When the first and most powerful mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakes after thousands of years of sleep, the mankind\'s faith seems endangered. With the powers of all mutants he has "consumed" he is aiming at restoring his empire and destroying the people who refuse to acknowledge his reign. He quickly gathers his "Four riders of Apocalypse" and it is only Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and his young team of talented mutants who can stop Apocalypse. Bolstered by stunning visual effects and breath-taking action sequences, Bryan Singer\'s delivery provides what it promises in terms of action.', u"Unfortunately, in terms of a story it is weaker than both Days of Future Past and First Class. There are two reasons for this. The first one is that the main evil character, Apocalypse is somehow not that convincing. This is valid especially if compared to the overall feeling of hopelessness that made Days of Future Past such a classic. The second reason is the predictability. Magneto's role (Michael Fassbender) in the whole movie is too predictable and halfway through the movie you will sort out everything and what is supposed to be a climax in the end of the story, will be just matching your expectations without adding up anything to the tension level. ", u'Nevertheless, X-Men: Apocalypse is still a spectacular summer entertainment that deserves to be seen in the theaters. Beautifully shot, starring beloved and talented actors, it offers what any X-Men or superhero fan wants even if it never reaches the level of its predecessors.
Not as good as the rest but it is a good movie to watch.
Better then the reviews lead you to believe, just wish this trilogy would have left someone else handle it other then Bryan Singer. First Class was awesome, but then Singer got his hands on them, & consistency was destroyed. If your an Xmen fan, I recommend seeing it, just to see how the stories play out, & most of the acting is good, even if the story lacks.
Not a movie the superhero genre really needed at this point. Plays like an episode and probably presented incorrectly. Set in 1983, we already know the X-Men won this one since present day movies have already come and gone. Why not present the sotry this way? narrated by a teaching Professor X to a class of students who then go out and win some other battle? Actor who plays Qucksilver has star presence and should get his own film.
I enjoyed some arcs and some of the seeds planted. But I think I enjoyed Days of future past more -
Although this movie certainly does not live up to its predecessor, X-Men: Apocalypse is a great time all around, especially if you're bored or lonely. Worth a watch
Another movie the critics got wrong. Mainly because they don't care about the context of the movie. If they complain about the costumes, then I'll give them that. However, this movie is so much better and well written than any movie on the market and deserves a much better rating.", u'You know the official well paid critics are corrupt when they say something like, "I was almost rooting for Trump" referring to hatred of mutants and the need stop their immigration. - quote from Rolling Stones Magazine. If Rottentomatoes or any similar source allowed the audience to silence/block these corrupt critics, then they would lose all their funding or stop being so fucking corrupt and actually review it with an unbiased view point.
Apocalypse: Everything they've built will fall! And from the ashes of their world, we'll build a better one!", u'X-Men: Apocalypse feels like an afterthought. After the very successful and pretty good Days of Future Past, director Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg drop everything that made their last film function as a narrative in turn for a woefully edited and flat experience for most of the runtime. Where this film shows flashes of really strong material in the first act with signature character moments put on by talented actors with Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy and younger talents like Evan Peters or Sophie Turner, the story runs from one scene to the next without giving enough attention to its characters or its storytelling.
there were discrepancies with character strengths but overall it was a fun film and I liked it afterwards also, so I'd say it was worth seeing
Great movie. While its plot and villain don't have the same thematic heft as Days of Future Past, and it does feel a little overlong in parts, it still delivers a thrilling story with great visual effects, solid direction and good performances from its cast, especially Turner, Sheridan, Fassbender and McAvoy. One of the most positive aspects of the film was yet another exciting and hilarious Quicksilver slow-mo sequence.
The conclusion to a trilogy that ran out of gas halfway through it's last feature. Any X-Men films to come will have a difficult time standing on such weak foundations. Talented actors and top-notch effects abound, but the bigger this movie tries to get, the more hollow it ultimately feels.
the time has come to stop babysitting Magneto's inner child. the will he or won't he in every movie is draining. i think this series has run its course
I had high hopes on this one , does not benchmark with the previous chapters .
This entry into an extremely long running franchise may not be as good as X2,Days Of Future Past or First Class but X-Men:Apocalypse still have it's moments which are making this movie really entertaining ride even if it's not a best ending for,otherwise,amazing trilogy (First Class,Days Of Future Past,Apocalypse)
The Apocalypse: The moral behind the story of this mutant was that he\xc2\xa0wanted\xc2\xa0to take over the entire world. To wipe out &\xc2\xa0erase all mankind; everything & to start again from scratch. The Four\xc2\xa0Horsemen\xc2\xa0that he gave more power- I feel that he\xc2\xa0really didn\'t. He gave them the power and\xc2\xa0strength\xc2\xa0that they always had\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa0within and he just\xc2\xa0tapped\xc2\xa0into it for them. They prevailed. All 4 of them prevailed! They conquered\xc2\xa0AGAINST\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0apocalypse. They\xc2\xa0proved that they were strong.\xc2\xa0The main\xc2\xa0and ultimate goal of all the X-Men films is simple: to tap into the power that you already have inside of you & to unleash its full power and potential WHEN NEEDED! This was sort of a back story at times because it\xc2\xa0demonstrated\xc2\xa0how\xc2\xa0Cyclops and Jean met; there was a scene with Wolverine and how he met Jean; how Storm came to be a student at the Gifted School and how Peter\xc2\xa0strives\xc2\xa0to fight for his family and\xc2\xa0how\xc2\xa0his power would\xc2\xa0always\xc2\xa0lead him to his father, but never caught up to him even though he is fast but is never there to catch him in time.\xc2\xa0Seeing Raven is always a good thing. She is the center of these films because she fights for\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0is right and\xc2\xa0for needs to be fought for- and not against.\xc2\xa0The character of Jean was essential in the film- the way that she believed in herself and her abilities\xc2\xa0to take down the\xc2\xa0most powerful of powerful and how the entire team came together\xc2\xa0to defeat "The End" was mind-blowing and\xc2\xa0she blew...She soared! She blew! She aimed and she fired! With passion! Flawless scene! The character of Magneto was epic because his power was the most valuable, but Apocalypse tried to corrupt his mind & use it for good as he did with the\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa03 horsemen, but Professor but\xc2\xa0Xavier got to him and\xc2\xa0made him\xc2\xa0realize\xc2\xa0along with Raven that\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0he\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0doing\xc2\xa0was wrong. He\xc2\xa0is strong- strong enough to\xc2\xa0prevail\xc2\xa0against what he\xc2\xa0was being\xc2\xa0manipulated\xc2\xa0into doing. At first, he nixes\xc2\xa0Charles\' ideals and goes to Apocalypse\'s\xc2\xa0plans because of what he suffered and went through but in life, that is what makes us strong- what he went through. There were jokes by almost every cast member or facial expressions that were funny.\xc2\xa0Like\xc2\xa0I always said and\xc2\xa0believe- adding a bit of humor in any film is always a good attribute.
I really enjoyed this movie. It was nice to see further exploration of Magneto's backstory to understand his motivations as an antagonist (not a villain). The new cast members were delightful and had good chemistry with the other X-Men: First Class/ Days of Future Past cast members. Quicksilver had the best scene, in the same vein as the one in Days of Future Past. SPOILERY: Also, Jean Grey is amazing and that powerful in the comics. That wasn't just a plot device of the film to win.
Perhaps the villain is too powerful and too big to be credible, and too dumb at times, but it's still a greatly enjoyable install of the mutant franchise :)
The X-Men movies now bore me
An entertaining third installment in the X-Men First Class series. It has its moments but sometimes feels overwhelming with everything that's going on. If you're looking for a fun and entertaining time, go see it.
X Men Apocalypse was by far 1 of Marvel's best I really enjoyed it...will see again
2.5* What is with these third installments in the X-Men Franchise? Something went terribly wrong...again. Compared to its two predecessors it feels like a huge mess - despite the fact that it starts off really well!', u"Loved Michael Fassbender. That man never disappoints... he has screen presence to die for, despite the fact that his character Magneto didn't get the emotional depth it deserves. The intention was there, the idea of his development might have been brilliant, but the bonding between the audience and Magneto feels harsh...and most of the time, it doesn't work. If it wasn't for Fassbender, it might not have felt a thing. Good performances from James McAvoy, Evan Peters and Jennifer Lawrence as well.", u"I think the movie's biggest problem is, that it has too much going on. It's messy and confusing, jumping from one scene to another without logic. It wasn't as dreadful as Batman vs. Superman, but still not good. It could have been so much more...", u'What bothered me as well was the movie\'s villain. Incredibly cartoonish, stupid and laughably weak. I couldn\'t take him seriously. He was good for a few laugh-out-loud-moments, the rest of the movie it was more like "WTF?!?". Bad, bad villain.', u'On the plus side, the movie was much fun. The action was mixed. Not as loud and awfully long as in Batman vs. Superman, but also not as well dosed as in Captain America: Civil War. The special effects was a mixed bag. There were times when it felt like a video game and other times it was awesome. The pacing was awkward. Most of its troubles are too be blamed both on the directors and writers. ', u'Bottom line: In the end, I would say unless you are a big fan of The X-Men, you should skip seeing this at theaters. It was not bad enough to kill the franchise, but it was disappointing, especially when you can see its possibilities all throughout the movie...
The X-Men movies seem to be cramming too many main characters into the screen time, which seems to take away from the overall plot; and to add on to that 'Apocalypse' isn't nearly as entertaining as 'Days of Future Past.'
Decent characters, true to their comics for the most part to keep the fan boys happy. Some changes but not too bad. A good plot but not as good as previous movies.', u'It was fun.
Good movie with a few suspenseful moments but still your typical X-Men movie.
