It's this light-heartedness that keeps Captain America: Civil War from succumbing to the kind of pretentiousness that marred Batman V. Superman.
The most mature, smart and fun Marvel movie. [Full review in Spanish]
Marvel's response to superhero fatigue, then, is clear: Double-down on character and up the storytelling's short game as well as its long game. It's an old-fashioned strategy, and it absolutely works.
Marvel, with its comic strip cool, Industrial Light & Magic control of gravity, what may be the largest ensemble of characters in its movie history and visual artistry, has done it again.
It wields an equally large cast with surprising dexterity, never losing sight of which players matter most to the story it's trying to tell.
Joe and Anthony Russo effectively hit the pause button on the Avengers franchise to address the human cost of "collateral damage," while still delivering the impressive action we\'ve come to expect from the Marvel franchise.
Civil War is fun. It's smart. It's coherent. And, most importantly, it allows its heart to beat strongly amid the chaos, with character moments and set pieces working in tandem to create perhaps Marvel's best film so far.
It's more of the same, of course it has a little more entertainment, but it's the same tendency to repeat what has worked in the past, nothing new. [Full review in Spanish]
This satisfying adventure is rich with the things Marvel comics always did best: critiquing the consequences of power in explosive, four-color form.
Like guest star Ant-Man in his new Giant-Man identity, this somewhat ungainly Marvel sequel almost collapses under its own weight.
