Its for hardcore fans of their superhero.', u'Post Spiderman, most of the superhero are shown in the light of Emotional, vulnerable & in Gray shades. ', u'This really affected fan base who really look for 1st slide to last spectacular action & not back story.', u'Not just this even Daniel Craig kind of James Bond movies hit bottom ~ failed to impress audience.

Theatrical cut: 3/5', u'Ultimate Cut: 4/5.
the only things I didn't like about this film was how rushed Doomsday screen time was and Jesse Eisenberg was not a good fit to play the role of Lex Luthor but other than that that Dawn if Justice was a good DC film
It's mediocre Level, There wasn't much Speciality going with half of the film, the beginning was super quick and just added scenes that took 5 seconds, I enjoyed the actors, I suppose they are suitable for the character, In some cases all the elements were not bad and does show a lot of effort into the excitements of all liability of the film, How Isn't Batman V Superman is the coolest thing to ever been seen? God only Knows like we do too, So I shouldn't be using the word only... Where was I? Oh Alright They shouldn't have added the CGI Monsters, That's what ruins the ending for all of us, Maybe it would be better if Lex Luther Build his suit and in to destroy batman and superman together... That would be much much better. I had a good time with the film, I recommend that it was a lot of fun seeing Batman V Superman Fight Together, When Ben Affleck plays batman instead of Bale And Henry Cavill keeps his character mode.", u'Grade: C+
Cinematic comic book masterpiece. Epic beyond imagination. The movie is a bit dark. But the battle is awesome between bats and superman. Having seen every single comic movie out there this movie stands out among the best.
Not as bad as some would have you believe. Affleck was suprising in his role, Cavil seemed to play by numbers for Clark Kent. Starts great with concerns over how much leverage super types can be given, especially when their work is destructive on a large scale, but then it throws all that concern away and ends with catastrophie anyhow. A terrible social message to send about chaos being inevitable in any discussion. But if we don't think too much about the narrative concerns, then it's worth your time... even despite the corny Freudian overtones.
La mejor del a\xf1o, sin duda alguna
POSSIBLY THE BIGGEST MOVIE OF 2016 IS HERE AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT IT'S......okay. This movie is a disappointment but disappointing doesn't mean bad. The main problem with this movie is the narrative and how it was edited together. Instead of a flowing movie, it felt more like a collection of scenes. Somewhere deep within that hodgepodge of scenes however, is a great movie. Instead we just got a decent flick.
I expected so much more. Disappointing.
What's with all the positive response? Zack has officially ruined DCEU by killing off the most important character SUPERMAN without earning his death!
Horrible! I had so much anticipation for this film. This was not only one big let down but was possibly one of the worst films I've seen all year. The film is so depressing, batman and Superman are idiots fighting each other for stupid reasons unlike the comic, and Jesse Eisenberg's performance as Lex Luther was so awkward to watch much like Jim Carry as the Riddler from Batman Forever.
Yeah I'm giving it a 5. Really underrated but had a lot of good (when a say good a say excellent-Christopher Nolan good) and bad (like bat nips bad). For example Ben Affleck was amazing as batman and Bruce Wayne but doomsday was shitty as hell. Gal Gadot was awe inspiring as wonder woman (that rock metal was radical when she appeared) but Jessie Eisenberg was mediocre as Riddler,,,I mean Joker... I mean Mark Zukerberg,..I mean Lex Luthor Jr (yeah I know he didnt actually play Lex) All in all I didnt like it but you have to compensate for these one star reviews, the story was thought provoking and the action was breathtaking More like a 4 but you know Henry Cavill has nice abs and Gal Gadots Hot so why not give it a 5.
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice is in my opinion a pretty good superhero film. It has really good performances by Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Jeremy Irons and Gal Gadot, but Jesse Eisenberg was completely miscast as Lex Luthor. It has well written dialogue in the screenplay by Chris Terrio, although there were some scenes I felt could either be left out or explained more. It also has an amazing score by Hans Zimmer and Junkie XL and Zack Snyder brings this film to life with his fantastic visual style.
This turned out to be the shit show it thought it would be. In all honesty, Affleck was maybe the best part of this whole fiasco. Why WB continues to entrust the future of this series to Snyder is beyond me. A dumb script, dour tone, and really misplaced as far as where a story like this should take place in the DC movie universe. This is not how you start. And 2 hours of supposed dramatic tension culminates in probably one of the dumbest scenes i have ever seen. One plus was Wonder Woman, though she was underused.
Greatest comic book movie ever.
Damn batman v superman back at it again woth 1 and a half stars
While it had a lot of potential, Batman V Superman divulges into a sloppy script and story in an obviously rushed attempt to start a Justice League franchise(just take that amazingly lazy Justice League cameo e-mail as an example of that).
Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice proves to the Audiences that DC Extended Universe is the best, though they still have to learn from Marvel. It still great movie, with a great thrilling action sequences, great performances from the casts, especially for Ben Affleck and Jesse Eisenberg, and also great visual effects, though it's too much conflict, darker tone storyline (Maybe DC wants to be darker than Marvel) and also a little anticlimax in the end, but it still good enough.
I don't know it's good or not.
Batman v Superman truely missed the mark. There are some great stuff here; action scenes, visuals, Alfred and Wonder Woman. Affleck is servicable and much better than early predictions, but he still has a long way to go. Eisenberg as Luthor is an enormous dividing factor, since despite a fresh take on the character, it barely resembles anything about the diabolical businessman. The script however is beyond poorly written and the terrible editing doesn't help either. Motivations are often not clear, many scenes seem out of order, and various story points are incredibly uninspired and convenient. BVS is still an enjoyable ride -specially in IMAX-, but it is nevertheless a dissapointment. 6.5/10
Batman Vs Superman is pretty self explanatory, lots of fighting, more fighting and even more fighting. But it delivers, the shots of the hand on hand combat between the bat and the god are incredible (no spoilers). But there is too much fighting. The movie tended to focus more on setting up for a future installment and forgot to be a good stand alone movie. The effects are stunning, cinematography; 9/10, but the problem i really had with this movie, is the plot. There is too much going on and the story and script are not delivered in a good fashion. Overall Batman Vs Superman was a little bland, but entertaining. If you prefer a classic, comedic, superhero Vs supervillain adventure, this movie probably won\'t peak your interest. But if you prefer a dark, emotional, "save the world" thriller, it may be right up your alley.
I feel like I'm the only one that loves this movie. I thought it had an intriguing story to it, amazing action, and the best batman EVER! It wasn't the most action packed of the other superhero movies but it was still good. Jessie eisenberg was amazing as lex Luthor. The only thing I didn't like is that it seemed that the ending had even more destruction than the first, and that I'm pretty sure batman kills in his movie (batman doesn't kill). I think that this movie was good and enjoyable.
Very dry story and just a build up to Justice League. Lex Luther was horrible, the story should end after the Batman and Superman Fight. Doomsday was a waste of time and unnecessary.

Mt foda', u'E que venha a liga...
Very interesting movie though very long and takes long to get interesting but a good movie overall. i'd give it 70%
I honestly went in wanting to like this movie thinking "eh, I usually don\'t agree with critics," but they were right. It just wasn\'t fun. You think that\'s what a superhero movie should be, right? Nope. It doesn\'t even deliver plot-wise either because it has many plot holes and weird plot devices (I\'m looking at you, Martha). Superman returns this time imitating a lifeless block of wood, while Batman and Wonder Woman deliver a great performance. The visuals are fantastic, however. Probably beats most Marvel movies (if not all). The action is just...meh. The movie wasn\'t fun because it didn\'t have those great moments that other superhero movies have. Like the quicksilver scene from Apocalypse and Spiderman in Civil War. Wonder Woman comes close but never delivers. I wouldn\'t recommend this movie.
Fail, fail, fail...', u'This movie paints two of the greatest superheroes as naive fools and offers no reason for a battle to occur.
appalling at the most, I am a huge fan of both superman and batman and I am disappointed with the killer bat and bad affeck acting. rotten to the core. guess I'll stick with marvel, I never liked marvel but at least the movies are enjoyable and not flat out dumb! listen to the fans we are the ones willing to see the movie twice or more. cast who you like but dont expect fans to go more than once. I personally saw star wars 3 times, why? because it was good!
Movies is good The problem is some people they don't understand the story at all
The biggest slap to the face for Superman fans. Follow Batman as you learn about his origin(again), why he needs to stop superman, how he obtains kryptonite, sees all his visions, how he meets all of the other superheroes, saves Superman's mother, and so much more. And follow Superman as he.. randomly saves people and... gets himself kill by Doomsday. Superman never even says one word to Wonder Woman. Movie falls into catering only to Batman fans. ", u"The movie itself is ok. Didn't dislike this movie as much as other people did. As long as you can piece together the randomness that this movie is. This movie gets a 2 1/2 stars, because overall it isn't about Superman vs. Batman, but the story of how Batman defeats Superman.
ok Movie, Biggest downfall was Lex Luthor.
This movie was everything I expected and more. The build up to the greatest gladiator match in the history of the world was amazing. The fight was a stunning visual performance for Batman and Superman. Ben Affleck was the Batman I've been waiting for a darker, more brutal Batman. Can we talk about Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman for one second oh my god, she was made for this role, she stole the show during the fight with doomsday
First of all lets get out in the open anyone who said that Ben Affleck couldn't play a good Batman(including myself) we should say sorry He nailed it.Now to the movie it starts off way to slow infact they don't get going to about half way into the movie.Their was way to much Lois Lane in this movie I swear she was in more scenes then Batman or Superman. I also didn't care for the Younger Lex Luther they should have casted an older actor and why did they make him act like the Joker so much.I liked Wonder woman but she could have been in it longer. The Fight scenes were good no beef there. I don't think Doomsday should have popped up until the next movie. The movie was alright not great DC comics are way behind Marvel and have alot to learn about making Comic Book movies.One last thing That Suicide Squad dosen't look all that great either so DC has alot of catching up to do!
It's a very non fun movie with not a lot of humor and the humor in the movie is very bad when you see a movie you usually want to have fun but this movie is no fun but the only good part of the movie is mostly Batman and a little wonder woman and the worst characters are superman and lex Luther
54%', u"Zack Snyder's tonally well-realized interpretation of the classic comic book characters has some stunning visual grasp, but the rest of the film is cluttered with indulgent set pieces, repetitive, one-note dialogue, and shoehorned reminders of DC's franchise plans.", u'V: 61%
As a batman fan I was impressed with Ben Affleck's performance. Story needed a little more depth but all and all a pretty decent and fairly entertaining feature.", u'Side Note: Hated Lex Luther and wish Doomsday was left out or better integrated into the story.
i like to review movies as they are; movies. I had a ton of fun at the movies but it does not mean it is by any means a good movie. 2 hours before the action begins? wut?
It was a cool movie. Its just my expectation for this movie was so high. I wannit to see a better film then it is. The trailer is much better then the movie.
It may not have been the greatest superhero movie of all time like everyone hoped, but it was far from being a bad movie. The biggest let down was the uninteresting battle against doomsday at the end.
Filled with comic book lore that may not resonate with most viewers, but Succeeds with great performances from newcomers Ben Affleck (Batman) and Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), though it fails miserably through Story and Character Development.
doomsday looked dumb not even doomsday more like general zod 2.0 lex luther wasnt that evil wonder woman wasnt hot enough she has no boobs,ass or face.and batman kills people not cool and mercy graves died
Poor plot, story line, character development and fight sequences. And Ben Affleck as the Dark night? What?!
Not as bad as the critic reviews make it out to be, but far from perfect as well. This second installment falls short of setting up the DC Extended Universe. A thin script is mostly to fault for this misfire. Ben Affleck, however, becomes the best Batman/Bruce Wayne we have seen on the big screen. Storyline can be jumbled at times. In comparison to Marvel's Civil War, the one thing Dawn of Justice lacked was the storytelling experience we have come to love with each Marvel installment. Not a bar film, but should have been better.
Thought this is going to be a lot worse movie than it is. It is way too long movie but you can see Ben playing role that he is going to be remembered by and doing it well. Movie has flaws that you can say but plot is very good and it gradually rises. You can see that Batman is fighting angrily and showing us some rage and Jesse playing role of Lex is so great. 78/100
brilliant cinematic comic book movie that finally shows us the dark twisted batman we deserve
Some things to like. I was actually one of the few people who believed Ben Affleck could pull off a good performance in Batman, and he was really really good in this role. Also, like all of Zack Snyder's films, the action and visuals are just breath taking. They seem pretty kick@$$. What lacks, and this tends to be a problem with most of his films, the story and characters could have been worked better. We see why Batman hates Superman but theres not much reason for Superman to hate Batman. The story is clunky, Eisenberg plays a very cartoonish Lex Luthor and his plan wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. Plus, Doomsday is a combination of the DNA of Zod and Luthor? That was the same with Nuclear Man. WTF Snyder?!
great movie not difficult to follow.. like other people said... \xf0~? waiting for justice league.
This Movie Was Crap!
very good but very anticipated ending
Para mi e una buena pel\xedcula. no la mejor pero cumple con el prop\xf3sito el de establecer el universo de Dc en el cine.
I think this is an amazing film, I really don't know what is wrong with people judging movies believing they are movie critics when they don't know nothing about movies. It was an incredible Hall of Justice Debut. Stop comparing with Marvel and finally understand that the movie theme for DC Comics is deeper and darker than others super heroes movies. 5 stars for David, Chris, Zack and Nolan as EP..Love it!!
Did not care one bit for Doomsday\'s "origin". Don\'t think the screenwriters of this flick have ever cracked open a single comic book by the plot of this.
great movie for fans
Movie was entertaining and had you going til the end....Affleck did well despite all the haters out there...I had a good laugh at the end with the depiction of small town America but then Hollywood rarely gets stuff like that right...All in all a decent flick!
Terrible premise with an annoying villain.
I've learned my lesson from Man of Steel, and this came as no surprise after how underwhelming which this turned out to be!", u"For starters, director Zack Snyder has clearly proven here that he's unable to tell a nice flowing cohesive story. You can say that it's David S Goyer's fault for creating this mess, and I completely agree, but the director is partially to blame for how this was also delivered. He tried with Watchmen, and to give him some credit, I admire him for staying true to the source material. As for Man of Steel, oh boy......good old Snyder made this in such a way that made it appear to be a huge staple to his legacy! He not only wanted me, but the rest of the general public to love this film. A major comeback for one of the greatest superheroes of all time, LOL! Him and the writers assumed that we are really that stupid to allow them to rewrite the character at the expense of basic common sense! What a douchebag! After all the mistakes that they've made with the film, the studio executives decided to be a bunch of cowards, and tell them to go along the same route. Boom! Surprise! This is what they shoved out, and here is what we ended up with!", u'The movie has such a big ego, it tries to beat the general public over our heads with wanting us to love it! It takes itself so seriously, and so dark to the point where they never bothered to ask themselves, "Umm, shouldn\'t we be a little lighthearted and have some fun with what we are working with?" Studio executives, "Don\'t you dare ask us such relevant questions again! Dammit, we must be different from Marvel!" Ugh, for the love of God, you fools! LISTEN TO US!', u"How can anyone not understand that Warner Bros is beyond desperate to compete with Marvel!? Haven't they ever heard of these two simple words, SELF RESTRAINT!?
Awesome action pact great fight scenes I laughed I cried go see this film don't take really young children
It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either.
Well this was probably the most bloated and messy movie I have ever seen.
I really enjoyed it. I don't know what all the hate was about. I loved Ben Afleck as Batman. I wasn't sure he was going to be that good but overall really enjoyed it.
a real let down, would've preferred a back story to lex luther at the beginning rather than seeing bruce waynes parents die for the millionth time.
I loved it, IMAX 3D was AMAZING the fights came at us and the plot was great people said it was crap but they were wrong.
It was not as good as Man of Steel. I loved Man of Steel. Good movie though, I'm writing this a month after seeing it and I don't have feelings of wanting to watch it again, nor feelings of wanting to bash it with the herd.
if you dont know the comics. your gonna be confused. good movie. but can be confusing.
Not so pleased for these two heroes.
Not as horrible as everyone seems to think it is, Batman v Superman does come with many gross threads but can still manage to entertain those with a passion for comics. Don't expect much action though.
I know I'm in the minority, but I loved this film! Continuing a conflicted and evolving Superman, and introducing a burnt out, murderous Batman, the story adapts and blends two of the comic's all-time most popular stories pretty well. It may not be perfect, but it IS the film I was looking forward to and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
I appreciate the effort to make a batman vs superman movie. I just think it would have been even better as just a Batman movie with superman coming in towards the end. The ending was horrible and It takes a long time for the story to really get going. Lex luther was bad casting.
my expectations for this movie I can't say we're big and I can't say were low.. I will admit I was looking forward to seeing how Ben Affleck would be as Batman and he actually did a really good job I'm kind of looking forward to seeing where he takes the character in future movies.. I know they took from the comic book but they certainly have changed Batman from the Chris Nolan Batman in this movie he actually kills people whereas in Batman lore he tries his best not to.. The fight between Batman and Superman was okay it was kind of cheesy the way it ended up and of course Wonder Woman was pretty much a non-factor in the movie it was pretty much just her in there too push her movie that will be coming out

You know that guy who's wearing too much loud stuff to get attention, but everyone knows he's just a tool who's trying too hard? That's what the screenwriters and Synder did to BvS.
LOVED IT!!! ROTTEN TOMATOES CAN KISS MY ASS!!!
Have never been more disappointed in a superhero movie. And that's saying something. I liked the green lantern movie and the hulk movie that everyone said sucked.
Just sit down Snyder and Superman. Let Batman/Afleck have a solo instead because his scene was the only thing right in this film.
I liked it, but wouldn't bother seeing it again. It felt like the same story as Avengers Civil War, but the only good and memorable part was Wonder Woman. Please re-cast Lois Lane, this girl isn't tough enough.
Dark, brooding, dour, boring... Everything you would and would not want from a Batman movie. No fault to the actors. Just poor script, production design, direction, etc. Where does DC go from here. Hopefully up. Can't get too much worse.
Filled with comic book lore that may not resonate with most viewers, but Succeeds with great performances from newcomers Ben Affleck (Batman) and Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman), though it fails miserably through Story and Character Development, The film would have received 4 stars from me if it were more centred, overall it is a fun time, if you've kept you're expectations for the film at a reasonable area.
If I hadn't seen Fant4stic I would consider this POS movie the worst CB movie of all time. The Jolly Ranchers scene alone is more corny than anything in Batman and Robin. Just watch the animated movie instead of this crap avoid it at all costs. It's not even a so bad it's good movie it's just a complete train wreck
Let's face it, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice is a mess. But it's a beautiful mess the same. Critics slammed this movie for being grim and depressing, but I prefer this tone about the film than the standard care free Marvel ones that are selling you the same movie every time. This movie has loads of flaws, sure. Jesse Einsberg's performance is out of place and awkward. There is one too many dream sequences so you are questioning whether he/she is dreaming or not. Batman breaks his moral code several times. Doomsday is thrown in and wasted and this movie is a 1/2 hour too long. But come on, who doesn't want to see the dark knight take on the man of steel in this political thriller/action packed movie/Justice league set up? Oh, and did I mention it's an ambitious, enthralling, and different superhero movie as well. The performances in this movie are top notch as well. This is definitely my favorite on screen Batman/Bruce Wayne and my favorite Clark Kent/Superman. Ben Affleck and Henry Cavill are now on my personal A-list. What about Wonder Woman? She was fantastic, period. Jeremy Irons is just as good as Michael Caine at being Alfred and the other actors play their parts perfectly. All in all, this movie was good, not great but good. B- movie for me. The critics got this one wrong big time.
There is almost no acting to be had in this movie - the only character who has any character is probably Lex Luthor.
Is it a terrible movie? No.', u'Would I see it again? Probably not.', u"This highly-anticipated superhero movie, and DC's response to the Avengers, failed to live up to its billing. While everyone wanted to see a great action movie with the Man of Steel and the Dark Knight battling it out with high stakes, what we got was a movie bogged down by court hearings, strange visions, and really no good action until the final act. ", u"You could tell Snyder was trying to make his characters more human. Clark Kent was seen having a daily life like all of us do. Bruce Wayne had the typical Batman backstory and was hurt by the collateral of Superman's latest battle. ", u"I was disappointed in the lack of action and in the way the movie resolved conflict. Yes, the end fight scenes were pretty neat. But, without giving too much away, there's one huge conflict that is resolved by something so small, I don't know how it made it into the final script. ", u"All in all, DC's attempt at matching Marvel failed. But the Justice League movies are set to come out next year, and hopefully they will be better than what we've seen so far.
Batman V Superman has been one of the most anticipated movies of all time as it it the first live action film to house Batman and Superman in one single film. This movie is kind of a mixed bag. It has great parts to it but theres so much negative things about it that it holds it back from greatness. Batman is hands down the best part of the film. This representation of Batman was really awesome and definitely in the running for best on screen representation of Batman.There are a few controversial scenes with his character that might put some Batman fans off and at first they didn't bother me but they didn't really explain it at all in the movie so hopefully there will be a better understanding of the controversial part before I make up my mind on how I feel about it. Superman on the other hand gets the short end of the stick in his own movie. Superman is beyond underused in the movie. The guy has barley any lines and doesn't do much of anything other than threaten Batman, Look all depressed and save Lois Lane every other scene with little to no development at all. Jesse Eisenbergs has been very controversial ever since he was cast as the infamous Lex Luthor and I gotta say those people were right to be cautious. He is by far the worst on screen Lex to date. Jesse's a good actor and all in other movies he's in but as Lex it doesn't work. He over acts so many times and his look and twangy voice doesn't do anything to help at all. His plan is so obscured and so dumb its baffling that its from Lex Luthor who is supposed to be a genius but in this movie he's a complete moron who makes the dumbest of plans that Im not sure how he thought any of it would work out in his favor. Doomsday who was technically the other villain is a complete throw away. They completely did that story arc completely wrong and crammed it into this movie when it didn't need to be in it. If you don't know by now then whatever but Superman gets killed at the end by Doomsday and its such a shame because they completely wasted that storyline so we will never get a proper death of Superman story line in the Man of Steel sequels that it should have been in. It felt like Venom from Spiderman 3. NO reason to be in the movie and is shoehorned in for the sake of a final battle which was very unneeded. Wonder Woman was pretty good in this movie even though she doesn't have much to do at all other than to be there to kick some ass. The actual fight between Batman and Superman was pretty awesome even if it doesn't hit as hard as it should have. Also the movie is way to depressing. Theres nothing here to make you laugh or smile and its just an uncomfortable movie to watch as its just sadness and brooding throughout the film. Superman's in it so It really shouldn't be that depressing considering he's one of DCs most lighthearted characters. I get that they may be trying to be different from Marvel but it doesn't need to be the complete opposite. The films story is also all over the place. To me it just felt like scene after scene was playing until the end and it wasn't stitched together properly and they didn't nearly focus on the Batman vs Superman part of the film enough for my taste. With all the negativity out of the way the film does have some quality al be it very minor ones. The visuals in the movie are pretty good for the most part and the action scenes are fantastic. Costume design is also fantastic and the movie is shot pretty good. Overall this is a bit of a disappointment being as its a movie we've been waiting for for a long time and it just doesn't have as much of an impact as it should. Coming from a DC fan I was disappointed on how so much of this movie was handled. 2/5
I thought it was better than it was going to be. Superman was not awful. Some entertaining scenes. The movie did feel a bit long though
Overall an enjoyable movie, but hindered by a meandering story that seems to take every side path without following any of them through. Ultimately appears that Snyder tried to do too much too quick and everything suffered. This should've probably been multiple movies to introduce the DCU better.
Waiting for the home release version!!! The theatric run is fine. Get lost, critics!
With an exceptional cast but a mediocre director Batman v Superman really did the characters justice and brought a wonderful new take on Batman to the big screen. The plot, although messy, actually stood out and resonated well with audiences, I feel. The darker, more down-to-earth tone felt fresh and new, thus gaining kudos. To say this film is awful is to say water is not wet. It's simply not true; the director made some bad choices but overall Batman v Superman was a hair short of a masterpiece.", u"Ben Affleck as Batman is astonishing. Completely destroying any scepticism anyone may have felt towards the casting choice, Affleck nailed the duality of Bruce Wayne and the Dark Knight. Henry Cavill continued to bring a more realistic take on Superman to the big screen and made him delight to watch. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is almost perfect. A stand out performer. While crazy and idiotic at times, Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor added humour to the lacking film.", u'the problems come with the cameos and intertwining plot/advertisements. When the cameos were on screen, it felt like a check-list to please avid movie goers. Although enjoyable, they simply felt like a commercial break to advertise the future instalments of the DCEU. The plot would be difficult to follow if close attention was not paid, but it was their and felt real and hooked me into the film.', u'Overall, I loved this film and, as a comic fan, adored the cameos and references as well as the runtime. I highly recommend Batman v Superman Dawn Of Justice to anyone that enjoys films, comics, comic-book films, and everything in-between.
Flawless and surprisingly deep hour and a half superhero film...over two and a half hours
It's ok. But it's sad toward the end because Superman died from the green monster.
Super movie for true comic fans
Ben Affleck carries the movie while almost everything else (Besides the few action scenes the movie has)is dull and is too busy trying to be Marvel but lacks the knowledge of what makes movies like Captain America:Civil War so great.
Boring movie from the beginning to the end. Offers nothing new and with predictable ending.
Batman v Superman, shows once again that Zack Snyder is a director which uses visuals and action in his own way and they look nice, but as impressive as that is to see, the story in this movie it's a mess. It might not bore you to dead or anything like that, but it's trying to be so many movies at the same time that it makes it harder after a while to concentrate on what was suppose to be important, The acting is good, specially on Ben Affleck as this new version of Batman. ", u'In short: It starts good enough, but it should have try to be a stand-alone movie, instead of try so hard on remind us that this is a "Cinematic Universe", we know. Trying to remind us with teases of "Future movies" don\'t really help to the immersion unless it\'s well written or helps moving the story on. ', u'But as great as this movie could have been it had some really nice moments and it was entertaining to watch, but I wished the main reason of the "Batman Vs Superman" had more logical reasons, than "Let\'s fight because... I don\'t like you okay, I\'ll punch you first. "
Zach Snyder's genius is lost on most viewers who have become used to getting there hand held in the over saturated world of Marvel movies. This is not a marvel movie. This dares you to think criticality. This is the thinking man's super hero movie. If you enjoyed Snyder's other films like Watchmen, Sucker Punch and Man of Steel...you will enjoy this movie.
Bvs was an amazing film. My favourite film of 2016 behind civil war. In my opinion there was nothing wrong with it. I personally could not disagree with the critics more. The plot makes perfect sense and is perfectly easy to understand. You just need to use ', u"your brain. Also the so called plot holes make perfect sense. Example: Batman agreed to help superman because he didn't want an innocent ", u"mother to die as a result of them fighting. Also superman couldn't hear ", u'Martha because she is never in danger so superman would not have it so ', u'he can always hear her. This film ticked all the boxes for me. It was everything it should have been. It Is probably one of my favourite films. Ben Affleck might even be a better batman than Christian Bale. His performance was the standout performance of the film. My favourite film by Zack Snyder.
This movie is horrible. There is nothin good about it. Superman is piece of shit. Batman is acting like a psycho. Batmans characterization is horrible. Nearly every single aspect about him is completely off. Snyder sucks. And Warner bros sucks. Stuck to DC animated films. Those are excellent. This live action shit needs to end now. Let the hype where off so you have a clear mind. Then watch it again. I can't wait for the bluray release then people will finally see this movie for what it is. Comepletly shit
Near Rubbish! But you will attempt to watch it for the concept and characters.
Not impressed at all. ', u"Could've done better, and not impressed with Affleck's Batman. ", u'Nowhere close to the dark Knight series.
I will try to not make this a millennium long, but I make no promises. Zack Snyder, you are a weird human being. You have taken 2 of the most iconic movie /comic book characters, and turned them both into jokes. This one I was not looking forward too, but still thought I would give it a chance in the off shot that I may like it, even a little bit, but alas, I did not. I should have known better hating Man of Steel as much as I did and knowing this was a "Sequel" to that, but again, gave it a chance, mainly because of the two characters, which I grew up with, and Amy Adams who I love in pretty much everything. Now, as I say that Amy Adams\' character (the iconic Lois Lane) was pretty much only in this so that Amy Adams could be in it because her character is has little to no impact on the story other than the fact that she is Clark\'s girlfriend and co-worker, she could have easily not been in this and it would have made no difference, but she\'s nice to look at so that\'s ok with me. Henry Cavill as Clark Kent/Superman, although better here than he was in Man of Steel, still has almost zero personality both as Clark and Superman. He shows no emotion whether happy or sad and doesn\'t react to things in the way he should, such as buildings blowing up, he\'s upset that he couldn\'t stop it, but acts like he doesn\'t really care. Also, the staff at the daily planet knows that Clark is Superman, um, where did that come from, they didn\'t know that before, hell Lois shouldn\'t even know it, so why does he wear those damn glasses, what is he hiding? Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman, although she was quite good, had very little introduction and about 2 lines, and also not nearly enough screen time (about the last half hour) to really get invested in her character. She is getting her own spin-off movie so I\'m sure she\'ll be better there. Now, Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor, is, well, over acting beyond definition. I grew up with the Superman movies and Gene Hackman never over acted like that. Eisenberg acts crazy and kind of goofy that he just wasn\'t really a very threatening villain at all. And finally, the thing that everyone was talking about when it was announced, Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman, was quite literally Ben Affleck as Bruce Wayne/Batman, he didn\'t talk or act like Bruce or Batman, he was Ben Affleck. I can\'t totally just blame him because the script was just god awful. Even Christian Bale, as much as I hated him as Batman, had better lines than Affleck was given. Another thing is that Batman fired way to many guns in this, Batman is not a G.I. Joe but here he\'s constantly shooting people, and he kills quite a few people in this, where he normally only kills the villain and his henchmen, minor nitpick but that\'s why we\'re here. Had enough yet, I hope not, because I haven\'t even talked about the story yet. This was one of the most confusing stories ever. I think there were a lot of scenes that had to have been cut from the final picture because there seems to be a lot of scenes that start and go nowhere or just come out of nowhere and don\'t go with the scene before and after it. There is far too much story and not nearly enough story at the same time that nothing flows. There is action in the middle and action at the end but both are underwhelming at best. The main fight scene between the 2 heroes is pretty pointless because honestly other than a minor detail by Batman, they really have no reason to be fighting each other, they are both good guys, but they both think that the other one is not, but no reason is given why. This is 2 hours and 31 minutes of a very confusing story, sub-par acting, and underwhelming action sequences. So with all of that being said I will have to say NOT RECOMMENDED at all, it\'s not worth your time, money, free passes, or patience to get through this mess. Snyder, you are reaching Michael Bay territory, watch yourself.
Batman shouldn't be a murderer. Too dark and bleak.
