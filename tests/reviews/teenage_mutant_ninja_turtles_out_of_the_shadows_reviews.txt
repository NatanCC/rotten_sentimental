The first was better!! *drops mic*
Light hearted and fun with a lot of nods to the cartoon. if you are a fan of the show then you will enjoy the ', u'movie . I went in expecting goofball type fun and got exactly what I expected. Had a good time over all.
Overall TMNT: Out of the Shadows was a enjoyable movie to take my kids to see. I think the developers and marketing overestimated the age range they are to tap into, as my 4 and 7 year old were dying to see it and it was rated PG-13 when it felt very PG in reality. ', u'The Turtles appeal to a younger demographicI would say ages 4-10 and if the makers were going for a nostalgia trip for older fans these are not the Turtles you are looking for anyhow.', u'Otherwise it was action packed and funny and a good representation of what the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are as a franchise. Not a terrible movie to go see with the kids.
On the one hand, it's pretty bad. The dialogue is speech after speech about how the next piece was figured out (wow, if I out this tube in it will instantly tell me about the aliens and how the world will crash down). It's bad. Pretty darn bad. Unbelievably bad.", u"On the other hand. They did keep it moving and the action and visuals in parts were fun to watch. Also, it's hard to not love the turtles' personalities.
Better than the first one!
Very fun and entertaining. In alot of ways its better than the first, it captures more of the 90's tone.
No doubt that is a lot better than the first one. A lot of fun but not enough Krang and not enough martial arts fights.
Worser than the first
This is the best one as far as I'm concerned! Great special effects in the 3D version and the turtles themselves are more interesting. The story line does take from some other adventure movies and the love story bores me. Nonetheless, I had fun!
Lacked the enjoyment and theatrics of the first one, felt a bit forced...not a bad movie, definitely not a good one though
A very enjoyable movie with a many problems
So Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 was overall a definitive improvement on the first film which was a disaster, still not a good film, but you can actually get a few moments of entertainment out of this film. First thing's first... if you did not like the tones, humour, or characters of the first movie, not much has changed, so there's a good chance you won't respond to this much more than the other. But some improvements have been made meaning that at this rate maybe in 12 years we will get a TMNT movie that captured the tones of the cartoon perfectly. There is a little more of a focus on the turtles in this film, either that or there was a little less of the April O'Neil. The chemistry between the turtles was a tad better, there was a dash of that fun campy humour here and there and a few moments where you can have a good laugh. Where this film crashes and burns however is with how they handle the plot and the many new characters.", u"The turtles in this film at times really delved into that darker more serious rendition from the first film but overall they had a slightly more lighter tone in this film, cracking a few more jokes and showed some pretty decent and amusing chemistry. The best parts of this movie (yes there are good parts) were when it was focusing predominantly on the turtles, none of the other side characters apart from Casey Jones and maybe Will Arnett's character really made a huge positive impact on the film. The human cast was mostly very meh, Megan Fox was just being the hot chick friend, Will Arnett was cashing in his paycheque, Tyler Perry was a crazy Neil deGrasse Tyson and uh.... Shredder was just there. Stephen Amell as Casey Jones was a great addition to the film, and probably the only one, he had a lot of character and charisma and was quite amusing. One or two moments he gets caught up in the silly humour, but overall the Arrow star elevates this film any chance he gets. ", u"But the real garbage in this film were the villains, but also the plot. It is very unfocused, messy, and falls back on the same tropes as the first film and pretty much every transformers film... Seriously, it was like Deja Vu for the 10th damn time. And man was this film busay, the plot holes were real, it was like when this film got put on the chopping board someone went absolutely ham on this thing. Entire scenes connecting two events felt missing and it didn't flow very well overall. And the way this film ends was like Paramount needed to wrap things up and get started on Transformers 9, so they finished everything in 5 minutes and moved on. Very rushed and not well thought through. ", u"Seriously though, introducing Bebop, Rocksteady, Krang and bringing back Shredder all in the same film was a huge mistake because the film just didn't know who to focus on as the villain and so no-one actually had enough screen time or development to be an interesting villain. Bebop and Rocksteady were introduced well and i was really digging their characters, but post-transformation they mostly became the device used for fart jokes and dumb humour. Shredder was about as useful in this film as those buttons on your jean pockets you never use, such a shame. And Krang, well he was most definitely an afterthought here, just thrown in the film as a device to get the main plot moving. Having no strong and entertaining villain really stuffed this film over and it could have been considered a good film if it had even one. ", u"So Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 isn't a good film, but there are some improvements upon the first film that when added together do let you enjoy parts of this film. It does have a lot of problems with their villains and the massive jumps in plot progression and unexplained conveniences but the good aspects such as parts of the humour manage to keep the film afloat. You should know by now whether it is for you or not, so enter at your own risk. ", u'5.5/10
i think this was alot funnier than the first one. i enjoyed watching this more.
Overall this movie was far more superior than the previous tmnt movie, and was quite enjoyable.
This one is bad. I love the first film. Shredder is worthless. Krangs voice sucks, turtles don't fight, Bad Casey Jones.
I think it's great! Very entertaining and I love the characters.
Cheesy most of the time almost breaking pg:13 barrier
This is definitely cowabunga
Fun and brainless summer action!
Just another original classic of entertainment history thrown in the mind of Michael Bay
I loved this Ninja Turtles animated show when I was younger but this film certainly didn't live up to that. It came off far too young and the story was stupid and boring at times. I love the turtles but that's about it with this movie
"Surprisingly a big improvement over the 2014 reboot, "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" is more snappier and faithful to the original comics and cartoons."', u'Movie Review: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: ', u'Out of the Shadows', u'Date Viewed: June 4 2016', u'Directed By Dave Green (Earth to Echo)', u'Screenplay By Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec, Based on characters created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird', u'Starring: Megan Fox, Stephen Amell, Will Arnett, Pete Ploszek, Jeremy Howard, Alan Ritchson, Noel Fisher, Tyler Perry, Brian Tee,', u'Stephen "Sheamus" Farrelly, Gary Anthony Williams, Brittany Ishibashi and Laura Linney.', u'Featuring the voices of Tony Shalhoub and Brad Garrett', u'Those green, pizza-loving ninja turtles are back and the surprising result is that "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" is a big improvement over the 2014 reboot from two years ago. It\'s more snappier and faithful to the original comics and cartoons but since this movie is produced by Michael Bay, it is just as loud and overblown as his three "Transformers" sequels. Not only does "TMNT: OOTS" feature not one, not two, not three, not four but FIVE VILLAINS! The filmmakers also brought along three-time Oscar nominee Laura Linney and Tyler Perry for the summer ride as well. Linney handles her role as a NYC police chief like an old pro but Perry goes way over the top in his role as a mad scientist who helps the Shredder in defeating the turtles.', u'The one thing I found totally inappropriate about "TMNT: OOTS" is Megan Fox and her school girl fetish-wear. I know she\'s supposed to be a reporter doing undercover work but come on Michael Bay, undercover in slutty Britney Spears mode! Nevertheless, the action is better and thankfully there is little turtle-flirting going on compared to the first one. The plot revolves around the Turtles, Leonardo (Pete Ploszek), Raphael (Alan Ritchson), Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) and Donatello (Jeremy Howard) dealing with the return of the Foot Clan and their arch nemesis the Shredder (Brian Tee) who has escaped from prison along with two dimwitted criminals, Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and Rocksteady (WWE\'s Stephen "Sheamus" Farrelly). ', u'With help from the Foot and his new accomplice, TCRI scientist Dr. Baxter Stockman (Perry), Shredder later transforms Bebop and Rocksteady into giant animal mutants. The turtles still fight crime in secret so that allowed former cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) to take all the credit in defeating the Shredder. Also thrown into the mix are news reporter and Turtles ally April O\'Neil (Fox) and Casey Jones (Stephen Amell, from TV\'s "Arrow"), a former corrections officer who quits the force and becomes a hockey-masked vigilante after his boss, police chief Rebecca Vincent (Linney) refuses to believe that he saw four ninja turtles driving a high-tech garbage truck.', u'Meanwhile, the Turtles have an even greater evil waiting in their shells, Shredder also teams up with a brain-shaped octopus known as Dimension X alien warlord Krang (voiced by Brad Garrett). His diabolical plan is to bring his powerful war machine, the Technodrome and use it to destroy all human life on Earth. With Batman, Superman and the Avengers all fighting each other, it is up to the ninja turtles and their human allies to stop Shredder and Krang from taking over the world.', u'As I said before, the action sequences are more competently staged than the first film and there\'s even a few funny moments. When the turtles have to skydive off their jet so they can reach to the cargo plane that holds Bebop and Rocksteady on board, Raphael, who is afraid of heights says "What would Vin Diesel do?". ', u'I don\'t know why Tyler Perry chose to do "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows". How does he go from playing a hot-shot lawyer in David Fincher\'s "Gone Girl" to a mad scientist who has brillant lines such as "Eliminate those Turtles!". Director Dave Green (Earth to Echo) and screenwriters Josh Appelbaum and Andre Nemec (Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol) capture the kiddie spirit of the cartoons and the early 90\'s live-action movies but this $135 million cash-bang is as brainless as the plot.', u'Bebop and Rocksteady make a good two-villain team in this movie but they\'re stuck with poor material. Even though "TMNT: Out of the Shadows" is rated PG-13 for sci-fi action violence, it\'s perfectly suited for 10-12 year old boys. It\'s mostly harmless and kind of enjoyable. I\'m not saying I liked this movie what I\'m saying is that I\'m not one of those Turtle-heads who enjoys "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" 24/7.', u'"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" is not a great slice of pizza but there are some flavors you\'ll likely enjoy so at least it wasn\'t as painful as I thought it was going to be.
It's the turtles...loved the action and the depth of the turtles as they go from wanting to be human to understanding who they are.
Yes... I went and saw this. I saw the first one and it was bearable. But this one? No. Terrible. It's all about the visual effects. Forget a decent story. Forget about depth of characters. The whole thing is boring and pointless. The only people I have met who enjoy these seem to be adults who grew up on these comics as kids. Surely they must be disappointed with the way these movies represent their heroes. Give it a miss.
Although the original movies hold a special place in my heart, I do enjoy these new ones.
It was very satisfying. I loved it. It only has one bad word and is one of those movies that can trigger your emotions. For example, you fell sad when characters are sad and feel surprised and suspense. Laugh at the jokes. Stuff like that.
It was pretty decent. I laughed.
Sequels to bad movies are always tough, especially from a business standpoint. Even if your follow-up is notably superior there's a good chance that no one will show up to see it. Audiences are typically afraid to spend money on something that is not a guaranteed entertaining experience and that seems to be the case with the sequel to 2014's forgettable take on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.", u"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is a bigger, better, and more fun sequel that eschews the generic superhero origin baggage of its predecessor and aims to make a brighter and more colorful movie aimed at juvenile audiences. And it succeeds in its limited ambitions, but it fails in becoming anything more and lacks the oomph to make it a true critical or commercial success. Or a particularly great movie. Its greatest strength lies upon the likeability of its main four characters and yes, their interplay with Megan Fox's April O'Neil. When the Turtles are cracking jokes and engaging in playful banter it's fun. When the movie has to advance its non-existent plot it's miserable. There are some new added elements that older fans may love such as Krang and Bebop and Rocksteady doing their Bebop and Rocksteady thing. (Stephen Amell tries to make a good Casey Jones, but he is given nothing to work with, so no dice Arrow fans.) But it's all fairly insubstantial and all the big names and lovely set pieces add up to jack shit. I forgot half the movie already and this is only two days after seeing it, so take from that what you will. In short, it's a passable rental or download title, especially for children, but it still falls short of the 1990 original or even its flawed sequel. Yes the one with Vanilla Ice.
If you've seen the first TMNT movie, then you already know if you'd like this sequel. It's a dumb, fun action movie with a fair few cheap laughs thrown in, and I like that it never really tried to be anything more than that. The plot was a bit like a cheap knock-off of the first Avengers movie, which seemed a bit weird and unnecessary. By no means was this film a classic, but if you have nothing better to do on a lazy weekend and you enjoyed the first film, then it's worth catching.
I enjoyed some of the aspects that they included in the movie with its slapstick humor, but some of the movie became kinda of bland. Overall it's much better than the movie tmnt.
TMNT out of the shadows review', u'After watching "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows," we realize this is yet another bad sequel--adding to the collection of disappointing movies for 2016. Moreover, Dave Green did no justice for this franchise. The movie focused way too much on a subpar storyline, and not enough on the action. The new characters they added (like Tyler Perry playing Baxter Stockmen) were also below average. Honestly, Mr. Perry\'s attempt at acting was more like a big joke the whole movie. Joining the ranks of Mr. Perry, Stephen Amell\'s role as Casey Jones didn\'t compel us, either. (Maybe he should just stick to playing Oliver Queen in Green Arrow?). We were also disappointed with how boring and pathetic Bebop, Rocksteady, and Krang were as the villains.', u"On a more suggestive note, we would've liked to see the dynamic of how intense and furious Leonardo and Raphael can get with each other when they get into it--which is something the fans always love with them. Instead, we were presented with a movie with no climax, that just skated to the end. As a matter of fact, the main battle, featuring The Turtles vs Krang (a moment we were all waiting for), was the most boring, non-crucial moment of action in the movie.", u"Overall, this movie was such a let down, and that's why we give it a bad 4 out of 10.
Great movie for ppl who grew up watching Tmnt
Excellent excellent movie. I ENJOYED it ALOT. :-) I hope they come out with another movie. Turtle fan since I was a little girl. Mikey was ALWAYS my favorite and still is tis this day. Lol.
Yes, another typical of TMNT, some funny- script with some dirty-jokes. This is not a serious movie to watch but at last you spend your 2 hours of time to laugh a few. Maybe it will cheer your one day.', u"Formula.. yes lets talk about Hollywood's formula in this decade. This seems saturated to me but its solely 3 things that Hollywood prioritize nowadays, visual effect, action scheme, and jokes. Yap those 3 things will made some dollars to persist its franchise. Oh my god its coming again in the next year or next two years. Holymackarel, a turtle makes me laugh on and on.", u'Just make sure you follow the movie formula and you got audiences on you. With some risk you could ruin the rating but of course you still got audience no matter what. Hellyeah because its a comic adaptation. It is an audience magnet bro.
A love letter to fans of the original cartoon. Not perfect, but, fun regardless. Fox is still a Fox
Better than the first one. This one was funny, entertaining and a fun date with the kids.
Starts with a bang, but quickly fades away. The turtles were in character (minus Leonardo), and most of the actors were great. I did however feel like Casey Jones was played terribly, and barely ever in character. And overall, the movie was just WAY too childish. It was at least entertaining.
My general rule is: if you're going to see a stupid movie, at least go to a FUN stupid movie, not a boring Michael Bay-produced excuse of a movie. While it is funnier than the original and boasts is a really great setpiece, this movie only offers D-List acting, a horribly written script, and cheesy (no pun intended) effects. Please, spare yourself and watch a better movie.
i used to love these turtles as a teen but watching this movie put me to sleep.. i think something was missing but i'm good
The movie was great although a few jokes were juvenile and silly. I was hoping for a darker tone to the film though it held up, looking forward to a third movie.
Better then part 1 way way way better
The turtles are back and better than ever!!!', u"The turtles are awesome, Casey jones was good, great to see new villains that we had never seen son the big screen before. Bebop and rocksteady are funny and great. Krang was good too, he felt to me a little rushed in, but he was overall great. It was funnier and sillier, which is great because that's how the movie its suppose to be, cartoony. Overall Bette than the first one. TURTLE POWER!!!!
As a ninja turtles fan, it's all you could ask for in a ninja turtles movie! Critics might not enjoy it, but I certainly did! Best tmnt installment since the live action 1990 film, for sure!
can't wait till the next one..
The movie is a smash hit the graphics are incredible. the movie delivers to the fans of the ninja turtle world.
Bebop & Rocksteady. "MY MAN!"
Way better then the first film.
OK, so yesterday I had a day off. Spent the morning celebrating Dad Day with he girls at school, then I had a couple of hours to kill - so I went to see TMNT movie. I needed a to give myself a couple of hours of mindless entertainment. It was AWESOME... yes it's bad acting, too muchCGI, way too much going on, lack of story, and just ridiculously over the top. BUT it was fun. A fun, kinda funny, cool movie to watch. ", u"What I never understand was critic review and ratings.. RT has it at 27% - of course it's not an oscar winning movie, but for what ti's supposed to be - I thought it was good enough.
a lot of action, storyline is ok. the turtles look a lot different from the original movie.
Eye-rolling fart jokes aside, this is a live-action version of the 80s cartoon, which makes me very happy, and all that we really wanted.
It a pretty good,fun movie, sure some parts look like they came from a video game but overall if you want to kill some time and just want to watch a movie i recommend you see it.
Typical Michael Bay formula: CGI-fest, crappy plot, unintelligent humour, unengaging action sequences, slomo Megan Fox in skimpy outfits and big heroes vs. alien invasion showdown in New York City. The only campy fun I could get out from this boring-ass, try-hard cartoonish sequel was, again, Michaelangelo. Although they listened to complaints and demands from the disastrous first instalment, Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady's introductions were highly disappointing and Shredder's practically still shit (at least he has an Asian face now, I guess?).", u"The turtles' personalities remain mostly faithful to the classic adaptations, but their fighting style and decision-making on the other hand... Even black cows crossing the street at night seem more ninja than these huge, loud, silly turtles. Oh right, I almost forgot, they learnt ninjitsu from a book Splinter found from the garbage in the sewers.
best movie ever seen
very good movie would watch again
5.5/10', u"I love the turtles and found myself enjoying every moment the turtles were on screen, but everything else in the film is so bad that it's hard to recommend this film.
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows really does try to rebuild a much better film from it's predecessor. This sequel is slightly better and makes a decent sequel. However, the majority of the reception chose to dislike this film while comparing it to the first movie too. TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES: OUT OF THE SHADOWS - 2.5/5 STARS.
Only 3 Words: Fast, Loud and Funny!
Obviously this movie is terrible, but then again, if you go back and rewatch the original series, it's pretty intolerable to begin with. Having said all that, this movie makes up for everything it fucked up in the last movie! It captures the mood of the 80's cartoon, focuses on the turtles, has genuinely entertaining action sequences, and gives us the characters that Turtles Fans have been begging for on screen for decades! Doesn\xe2??t hold a candle to the original two, but this movie was fucking fun.
Not as good as the first one, but has it's moments. More for Kids but drawn out, lot going on and nothing at the same time. Fun movie, after a ton of jokes some hit the mark.
Not nearly as terrible as I thought it was going to be. Nice to see some other characters in this one.
Just saw this movie just before and eh it was okay *SPOILERS* The Ninja Turtles don't even fight that much in the movie and Shredder absolutely also does NOTHING I mean it literally NOTHING, so would I recommend this movie to anyone? Yeah kind of but don't expect anything great.
TMNT 2 is only good for the first act of the movie. After that it just drags on and becomes a bore. There are so many unnecessary scenes that really dragged the movie down. The best part about it was the turtles. Megan Fox didn't need to be in this movie. She was literally just there to give exposition during key points and for eye candy. Shredder was also very underused and thrown under the bus. An ok cartoonish movie.
I really wanted to like it.....
Equally good as the first.
not great but good enough.
good story lots of action
Incredibly dumb and juvenile, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows ditches the dark and gritty tone of the last film. During a prison break Shredder is transported to an alternate dimension where he meets and teams up with an alien cyborg named Krang in order to conquer the Earth; however, the Turtles stumble onto Shredder's plan and attempt to stop him. The plot's extremely convoluted and is full of contrivances. And the creature designs are cartoonishly silly. But worst of all, the fight scenes are rather mundane and unimpressive (especially for ninjas). Taking a 180 degree turn in the wrong direction, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is massive stupid and humorless.
Just a very fun movie, which is all Ninja Turtles really need to be.', u"After all these years seeing TMNT movies ignoring most of the source villains, it's great to see them done well.
Not quite what I expected but a pretty ok movie!
I have a husband who is absolutely obsessed with the ninja turtles and when the new movies come out he insists on dragging me to see them . Or at least that's how I used to feel about it ! However after seeing the first movie, I went willingly to see the second ! The ninja turtles exceeded my expectations again!
I felt like a kid again. They got all the personalities of the Turtles right and Bebop and Rocksteady were great comic relief.
Who doesn't love the TMNT adventurous characters?!!?! This TMNT film is much better than the previous one with better special effects and character enhancement. I got shell shocked and LOVED it!
Poof mind blown?? Better than the first
Look no its not the greatest thing to hit the big screen but the movie was still good and worth seeing. It was better then the first(I liked the first one too)They finally brought Rocksteady and Bebop into the movies and they nailed them too. Krang was also done well. I don't know if it will get a 3rd movie it will depend on how this one does but I would go see it. Fun for all ages and if your and fan of the 80's cartoon you won't be disappointed
Really Really Good Film
Much better than the last. It has its kinks but overall felt like a long ep from the cartoon series. The latest nick series and the original. Def a homage to old school fans. It did at times feel like Avengers and Transformers, but it is another comic book movie technically so I didn't mind that much.
why is it really that bad?
Best in the series. Ninja turtles and outside characters well done. Moved right along. Very good.
This movie is just full of cheesy jokes that made me want to puke out everything inside me. The jokes were too cringy and as I've heard, this is just another excuse to get Megan Fox's breast on the big screen.", u'The title is "out of the shadows", so it means that everyone sees them right? Nope. That\'s right when they had left the sewers to stop Krang\'s warship. They were being hidden by a S.W.A.T team. The team was blocking the turtles as they entered a building to get to the roof. They weren\'t really out of the shadows.', u'We also see the return of Shredder, who was irrelevant and useless. He was in the movie for a good amount of time after being frozen by Krang.', u'Then we see Oliver Queen- Oh wait, that is a different level of, well, bad. We see a new character named Casey Jones. He was just as useless as Shredder was in the movie, he was barely even in the movie for crying out loud!', u"And about that Megan Fox scene where she had to change to a short skirt to stop the delivery guy was not necessary. She could have just easily walked right next to the guy and secretly upload files, as I said before, this is just another excuse to bring Megan Fox's tits on screen.
Apparently the writers, directors, and produces decided this movie need to be geared for on adolescent males.
Not as painful as the first one but forgettable at best
Yes, I did this to myself again....Well....they finally get all the characters in a Turtles movie, Shredder, BeBop, Rocksteady, Casey Jones and Krang, and it's all for not, and why, because it's all crap. Nothing in this is good, NOTHING. All of the characters are either throw away or extremely annoying. Bebop & Rocksteady overstay their welcome extremely fast, Shredder is non existent, Krang is blink and you'll miss him and Casey Jones is not likeable in any way. Megan Fox obviously did not want to be in this and it shows because she shows no personality or excitement, oh wait, no, that's just Megan Fox in general, nevermind. They gave Donatello more to do this time but again, it was all for nothing. Leo was just a jerk AGAIN, Raph was kinda wimpy, and Mikey...ugh...shut up. They updated, actually downgraded, the original Secret Of The Ooze film from 1991 which was a much, MUCH better movie. I'm sure there will be 1 or more of these to come, but I think I'm done, but I've said that before so I'm sure you'll see another review down the road, why, because I'm crazy. SKIP unless you're crazy like me.
I loved the movie especially when they added more characters from the show and the comic books so if you love the turtles then you would know who they are and what is their weakness and strengths and please don't let your kids kick the chairs in the movie theaters. ", u'From 10 year old.
fun! much like the cartoon story line. I enjoyed it.
A good redemption of the first film
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out Of The Shadows still a great sequel, bigger visual effects, and an improvement to its predecessor, but it still lacks of the storyline, and also a creepy villain that is not bad at all.
Another fun filled ride with the turtles and equally as enjoyable as the first film
Great action movie. Fun.
Fun but has its flaws. Better than the last one.
Turtles will always be fun to watch. Megan Fox is gorgeous. Shredder, Krang, Beebop and Rocksteady!? How can you go wrong.
Unlike it's predecessor, this one stays true to its origins in introducing characters like Bebop and Rocksteady whilst bringing back the familiar faces of Megan Fox and Will Arnett. Stephen Amell, who is notable for his portrayal of the Green Arrow, also joins the cast as the vigilante, Casey Jones.", u"It's not good nor is it bad, it's a cheap thrill which pulls out all the stops you'd expected from a movie produced by Michael Bay.
This movie would be getting a higher rating if kids voted. It is very animated and follows the 80s cartoon. Better than the last one. I was happy to see the foot were actually using swords instead of guns this go around.
A let down ????. I wanted this Movie to be good, how could it go wrong? It has Bebop, Rocksteady, Kraang & Stephen Amell from "Arrow" as Casey Jones. ', u'On Paper this all looked so promising however nothing lived up to my expectations. ', u"It felt like an episode of the 80's cartoon instead of a well thought out comic book movie such as anything by Marvel. I am alright with it feeling like the cartoon but in my opinion if your going to do that then you should go all out & get the original voice actors from the cartoon for all these CG characters. Instead we have guys like Shamus from WWE ??.", u'With all that said I hope it makes enough money for a third movie & once again I will hope blindly that the next will will be good Instead of just average.
Two years back when the TMNT film series got rebooted, I\'ve observed that the filmic iterations released around an animated TV series currently airing at the time of release, faithfully reflected upon. To elaborate: the first three films reflected the tone of the original 80s cartoon series; the fourth film with an assumed continuity reflected the 2003 series; then finally the reboot trilogy started in 2014 reflected the 2012 series. The way the films over the years reflects the television series with faithfulness is based on the matching preference of the timely viewership, fueling their enjoyment upon seeing the released film. The 2014 reboot does that, while its sequel today "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" drawn some strings from the 80s cartoon to today\'s current animated series when done some lightening improvement over its same-valued predecessor.', u"The reboot's sequel takes place a year later where we see the Turtles are dealing with their existential dilemma by accepting not to receive credit for their heroic deeds they've done to their city. Their next mission brings them to face more foes as the Shredder's escape brought in an alliance with the Krang and recruited two other escaped prisoners as subjects into mutants known as Bebop and Rocksteady by Baxter Stockman. As the events enlarges, and the Turtles deal with their dilemma that intersected with what they're dealing with, helped by April and Vernon, along with newcomer skilled in Hockey Casey Jones who has faced the new mutants before, they went to thwart the Shredder's plans of an incoming invasion.", u"Basically a continuation of its predecessor's elements with the Turtles' dilemma additionally thrown in as a probable original observation of their mythology that also touched base with reality on acceptance in society - a similar, related fashion seen in the X-Men. In the critiquing light of the elemental continuity is the sense of being a more fun ride through the lightening improvement of the CGI Turtles' slightly increased screen time that displays more of their dynamics alongside with the overall funnier humor.", u"In addition to the fun ride, the effects-driven sequences as the film's makeup to deliver the action and the social blend are still well done. On another branch is the appealingly charismatic performances with Megan Fox as April O'Neil sharing a friendly chemistry with Stephen Amell's Casey Jones, welcomed to the team and filled the gang as a whole. And to further the enjoyment level for a convert or a non-convert, producer Michael Bay's collaborator Steve Jablonsky composed what sounds like a definitive update score for the four brothers.", u'What flaws to pointedly criticize that are still apparent, or couldn\'t be shaken off, starts with the derivation that still drives the film like its predecessor within the respective, and recommendable genres, particularly the returning vibe previously felt in "Transformers" that really couldn\'t be shaken off. Then on another that may have a relation to the original 80s cartoon with required familiarization is towards the portrayals and CGI treatment of the antagonists that seems juvenile with the silliness being unfunny to the broader audience and/or today\'s viewership who enjoys the 2012 series. Not interested on seeing that cartoon series, but it seems that while on the faithful route, it was only calling for recognition of the earlier fans\' judgment when the overall characterization is mostly well-known to the spectatorship without going back in time.', u'Going back to how this sequel improved over its predecessor, the noticeable flaw of being marked with the similar kit used in "The Last Airbender" through few areas such as the designs and cinematographic structure was dropped. This opened opportunities on few recasting and designs.', u'"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows" may be almost the same as its predecessor, which could be a good thing as long it retained the experience of being an absolute fun ride made up by the aspectual qualities, including the direction on the faithful route and improvement for the good of the enjoyment level. Despite still deriving along putting in some juvenile silliness that are away from the main spotlight, the film\'s at least the best yet of the TMNT franchise. (B+)

This movie was very entertaining maybe not as polished as the previous, but the story worked and if you laughed and had a good time was the others you'll like this one too.
Gave me exactly what I wanted WAY better than the 1st one
Hilarious kids movie! It's enough to keep the franchise moving forward!
