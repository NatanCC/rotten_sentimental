Didn't suck but not the best installment.
Was not very happy with the movie. They wasted the chance to make one of Marvels best villians shine
The movie was beautiful it truly pulled the franchise together
this movie sounds exciting
This was by far my favorite X-Men movie by Bryan singer. I loved how everything from the past movies came together, and it collides with the actual comic books now. It's a new generation of X-Men, and I'm excited to see how the future can hold its glory.
X-Men: Apocalypse is an over-the-top superhero film that's entertaining but not very substantive. When an ancient and powerful mutant is resurrected from the ruins of an Egyptian pyramid he puts together a group of follows to help him conquer the world, and when Magneto falls under his thrall Mystique seeks out Xavier to help rescue him. Several new/original trilogy characters are re-introduced, including Storm, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Nightcrawler. However, this kind of further muddles up the X-Men continuity. Yet there are a few interesting character developments, and some intriguing changes in the new timeline. And, the special effects are especially good and bring a lot of energy and excitement to the action scenes. While it's definitely one of the weaker entries of the series, X-Men: Apocalypse is still a fun sci-fi/adventure film.
I enjoyed it with the kids....definitely movie size screen made it better
Great Movie - Go see it the heck with the reviews
Not the greatest to come out of the X-Men films, and unfortunately, a disappointment since Days of Future Past gave this film a new timeline to explore new environments and new characters! Some cool scenes and tension save this movie from being as bad as X3!
Good...but not amazing!
Awesome movie !! Exciting to watch.
Standard X-men movie with some great moments fails to make us care about the stakes
So many plot holes, cheesy dialogue and flaws! They made Oscar Isaac a wooden actor! I didn't know that was possible.
Very good movie, but not great movie. Worth going to a theater to see the action on a big screen, but not likely something you will be wanting to shell out cash to see over and over in theaters.
This movie had funny moments, and a haunting villain. It manages to pull off an entertaining sequel.
While it offers some great sequences, you kind of feel like you've seen this before. The only really new thing is the Quicksilver scene, which was just pure joy. I wouldn't call it better than Civil War, but it's miles better than Batman v Superman.
Good Marvel movie. Nice characters, and quick silver was awesome. Highly recommended. Days of the future past was better, tough.
Like the reviews say, it's pretty disappointing. Feels like they used every cheesy gimmick of the previous collected X-Men films and barely bothered developing any of the new characters. Isaac did his best with Apocalypse but the character still lacked a lot of the mystique and authority of the comic version. None of the characters really made any sense in the X-Men movie storyline let alone the comic one. Good things, Fassbender was one of the highlights as usual (mainly because his character is so tragic), and Quicksilver stole the show with the tiny bit of screen time his intro occupied. Oh, and the small final scene is an awesome treat for all the 90's X-Men nerds.
Great addition to the franchise
Too much going on, and too many characters.
Days of the Past was light years better. Don't get me wrong; I liked this movie. I felt that it was going away from the comic. For example, Storm was never one of the Four Horsemen in the comic books with Apocalypse. Who carries this movie is Quicksilver! Boy, he was hilarious.
I'll give it this....at least it was better than Batman vs Superman.
Great special effects. great story line....different than the comics...but the movies have created their own universe of sorts. I enjoyed it putting aside the difference in story line. Alot of action scenes & some of the "feels" randomly thrown in here & there.
Bit slow at first, quicksilver is the best thing in the movie. Great ending.
Awesome. Can't go wrong with Marvel or DC movies. Bringing my childhood comic books to life. Can't wait for next movie.
even though some people got over sensitive about a billboard, the movie is worth seeing if you like these types of movies.
The movie was great, only problem was it didn't stick to the comic story line like it should have.
X-Men: Apocalypse still a great movie in The X-Men Franchice, full with action and visually stunning, but it's also having a generic storyline, and also a clich\xe9d villain that isn't as good as many villain have to be, though it is better than X-Men: The Last Stand.
In all honesty, as far as a pure X-Men adaptation goes, this is the movie that, in many ways, I've been waiting for. My favorite films in the franchise are still Deadpool, DOFP, and First Class, but this is a close Fourth (along with X2), and is probably the most loyal in terms of giving each X-Man present his or her deserved amount of screen time (aside from Psylocke and Archangel, but at least they did SOME cool things). As a huge fan of the X-Men comics, I must say that some of the earlier X-Men films that garnered a lot of recognition (such as X-Men and X2), though fine films, are not the best adaptations of their source. In these films, too much focus is placed on Wolverine, while many other popular mutants are thrown to the wayside. On top of that, the earlier X-Men films lack brilliants colors and high stakes battle scenes that are present in both the comics and the new Apocalypse film. Now, I don't want it to seem as though I'm bashing the first two films in the original X-Men trilogy, as they are fantastic trendsetters. Still, comic book movies should be made, first and foremost, for the fans. Make a great film, but don't neglect the source material. A large part of me still wants to see the X-Men film property go to the MCU, but this film gave me a little more faith in the strength of this franchise. As of now, I prefer the new X-Men trilogy (First Class, DOFP, and Apocalypse) to the first trilogy (X-Men, X2, and The Last Stand). If you, like me, are looking for a high stakes X-Men movie that really showcases the camaraderie and fantastical battles from the comics, you will very likely enjoy this movie. Regardless of the critics' reviews, this X-Men fan here approves of Apocalypse. Still, maybe we could give the MCU a couple more of Fox's X-Men? Even if it's just Deadpool and Wolverine...? Just a thought...
Thought it was great - Exactly what it is supposed to be. Oscar Isaac was excellent in the role. One of the better X-men sagas
The film was not the best in the X-Men series but still a must watch. It gives an introduction into some of the main characters we see in the first few X-Men movies. Personally I thought Oscar Isaac was fantastic as the villain Apocalypse.
What's not to love about X-Men? No complaints here.
Exciting at the beginning, but lost in the middle.
i have seen this movie and its the best movie i have ever seen 11/10 from me!!!
Usual over the top explosions and face smashing. No acting ability by anyone. Cornball show.
Best comic movie this year
A long awaited closing of the latest X-Men trilogy, Apocalypse is entertaining, visually stunning and violent addition to the franchise, but yet it fails to reach the brilliance of Days of Future Past or the delightful level of entertainment provided by First Class. Surprisingly predictable, with much action and less content, Apocalypse delivers the pop-corn entertainment that every summer blockbuster is expected to do, but fails to deliver the content which made the first two installments formidable movies. ', u'When the first and most powerful mutant Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac) awakes after thousands of years of sleep, the mankind\'s faith seems endangered. With the powers of all mutants he has "consumed" he is aiming at restoring his empire and destroying the people who refuse to acknowledge his reign. He quickly gathers his "Four riders of Apocalypse" and it is only Professor Xavier (James McAvoy) and his young team of talented mutants who can stop Apocalypse. Bolstered by stunning visual effects and breath-taking action sequences, Bryan Singer\'s delivery provides what it promises in terms of action.', u"Unfortunately, in terms of a story it is weaker than both Days of Future Past and First Class. There are two reasons for this. The first one is that the main evil character, Apocalypse is somehow not that convincing. This is valid especially if compared to the overall feeling of hopelessness that made Days of Future Past such a classic. The second reason is the predictability. Magneto's role (Michael Fassbender) in the whole movie is too predictable and halfway through the movie you will sort out everything and what is supposed to be a climax in the end of the story, will be just matching your expectations without adding up anything to the tension level. ", u'Nevertheless, X-Men: Apocalypse is still a spectacular summer entertainment that deserves to be seen in the theaters. Beautifully shot, starring beloved and talented actors, it offers what any X-Men or superhero fan wants even if it never reaches the level of its predecessors.
Not as good as the rest but it is a good movie to watch.
Better then the reviews lead you to believe, just wish this trilogy would have left someone else handle it other then Bryan Singer. First Class was awesome, but then Singer got his hands on them, & consistency was destroyed. If your an Xmen fan, I recommend seeing it, just to see how the stories play out, & most of the acting is good, even if the story lacks.
Not a movie the superhero genre really needed at this point. Plays like an episode and probably presented incorrectly. Set in 1983, we already know the X-Men won this one since present day movies have already come and gone. Why not present the sotry this way? narrated by a teaching Professor X to a class of students who then go out and win some other battle? Actor who plays Qucksilver has star presence and should get his own film.
I enjoyed some arcs and some of the seeds planted. But I think I enjoyed Days of future past more -
Although this movie certainly does not live up to its predecessor, X-Men: Apocalypse is a great time all around, especially if you're bored or lonely. Worth a watch
Another movie the critics got wrong. Mainly because they don't care about the context of the movie. If they complain about the costumes, then I'll give them that. However, this movie is so much better and well written than any movie on the market and deserves a much better rating.", u'You know the official well paid critics are corrupt when they say something like, "I was almost rooting for Trump" referring to hatred of mutants and the need stop their immigration. - quote from Rolling Stones Magazine. If Rottentomatoes or any similar source allowed the audience to silence/block these corrupt critics, then they would lose all their funding or stop being so fucking corrupt and actually review it with an unbiased view point.
Apocalypse: Everything they've built will fall! And from the ashes of their world, we'll build a better one!", u'X-Men: Apocalypse feels like an afterthought. After the very successful and pretty good Days of Future Past, director Bryan Singer and Simon Kinberg drop everything that made their last film function as a narrative in turn for a woefully edited and flat experience for most of the runtime. Where this film shows flashes of really strong material in the first act with signature character moments put on by talented actors with Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy and younger talents like Evan Peters or Sophie Turner, the story runs from one scene to the next without giving enough attention to its characters or its storytelling.
there were discrepancies with character strengths but overall it was a fun film and I liked it afterwards also, so I'd say it was worth seeing
Great movie. While its plot and villain don't have the same thematic heft as Days of Future Past, and it does feel a little overlong in parts, it still delivers a thrilling story with great visual effects, solid direction and good performances from its cast, especially Turner, Sheridan, Fassbender and McAvoy. One of the most positive aspects of the film was yet another exciting and hilarious Quicksilver slow-mo sequence.
The conclusion to a trilogy that ran out of gas halfway through it's last feature. Any X-Men films to come will have a difficult time standing on such weak foundations. Talented actors and top-notch effects abound, but the bigger this movie tries to get, the more hollow it ultimately feels.
the time has come to stop babysitting Magneto's inner child. the will he or won't he in every movie is draining. i think this series has run its course
I had high hopes on this one , does not benchmark with the previous chapters .
This entry into an extremely long running franchise may not be as good as X2,Days Of Future Past or First Class but X-Men:Apocalypse still have it's moments which are making this movie really entertaining ride even if it's not a best ending for,otherwise,amazing trilogy (First Class,Days Of Future Past,Apocalypse)
The Apocalypse: The moral behind the story of this mutant was that he\xc2\xa0wanted\xc2\xa0to take over the entire world. To wipe out &\xc2\xa0erase all mankind; everything & to start again from scratch. The Four\xc2\xa0Horsemen\xc2\xa0that he gave more power- I feel that he\xc2\xa0really didn\'t. He gave them the power and\xc2\xa0strength\xc2\xa0that they always had\xc2\xa0from\xc2\xa0within and he just\xc2\xa0tapped\xc2\xa0into it for them. They prevailed. All 4 of them prevailed! They conquered\xc2\xa0AGAINST\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0apocalypse. They\xc2\xa0proved that they were strong.\xc2\xa0The main\xc2\xa0and ultimate goal of all the X-Men films is simple: to tap into the power that you already have inside of you & to unleash its full power and potential WHEN NEEDED! This was sort of a back story at times because it\xc2\xa0demonstrated\xc2\xa0how\xc2\xa0Cyclops and Jean met; there was a scene with Wolverine and how he met Jean; how Storm came to be a student at the Gifted School and how Peter\xc2\xa0strives\xc2\xa0to fight for his family and\xc2\xa0how\xc2\xa0his power would\xc2\xa0always\xc2\xa0lead him to his father, but never caught up to him even though he is fast but is never there to catch him in time.\xc2\xa0Seeing Raven is always a good thing. She is the center of these films because she fights for\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0is right and\xc2\xa0for needs to be fought for- and not against.\xc2\xa0The character of Jean was essential in the film- the way that she believed in herself and her abilities\xc2\xa0to take down the\xc2\xa0most powerful of powerful and how the entire team came together\xc2\xa0to defeat "The End" was mind-blowing and\xc2\xa0she blew...She soared! She blew! She aimed and she fired! With passion! Flawless scene! The character of Magneto was epic because his power was the most valuable, but Apocalypse tried to corrupt his mind & use it for good as he did with the\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa03 horsemen, but Professor but\xc2\xa0Xavier got to him and\xc2\xa0made him\xc2\xa0realize\xc2\xa0along with Raven that\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0he\xc2\xa0was\xc2\xa0doing\xc2\xa0was wrong. He\xc2\xa0is strong- strong enough to\xc2\xa0prevail\xc2\xa0against what he\xc2\xa0was being\xc2\xa0manipulated\xc2\xa0into doing. At first, he nixes\xc2\xa0Charles\' ideals and goes to Apocalypse\'s\xc2\xa0plans because of what he suffered and went through but in life, that is what makes us strong- what he went through. There were jokes by almost every cast member or facial expressions that were funny.\xc2\xa0Like\xc2\xa0I always said and\xc2\xa0believe- adding a bit of humor in any film is always a good attribute.
I really enjoyed this movie. It was nice to see further exploration of Magneto's backstory to understand his motivations as an antagonist (not a villain). The new cast members were delightful and had good chemistry with the other X-Men: First Class/ Days of Future Past cast members. Quicksilver had the best scene, in the same vein as the one in Days of Future Past. SPOILERY: Also, Jean Grey is amazing and that powerful in the comics. That wasn't just a plot device of the film to win.
Perhaps the villain is too powerful and too big to be credible, and too dumb at times, but it's still a greatly enjoyable install of the mutant franchise :)
The X-Men movies now bore me
An entertaining third installment in the X-Men First Class series. It has its moments but sometimes feels overwhelming with everything that's going on. If you're looking for a fun and entertaining time, go see it.
X Men Apocalypse was by far 1 of Marvel's best I really enjoyed it...will see again
2.5* What is with these third installments in the X-Men Franchise? Something went terribly wrong...again. Compared to its two predecessors it feels like a huge mess - despite the fact that it starts off really well!', u"Loved Michael Fassbender. That man never disappoints... he has screen presence to die for, despite the fact that his character Magneto didn't get the emotional depth it deserves. The intention was there, the idea of his development might have been brilliant, but the bonding between the audience and Magneto feels harsh...and most of the time, it doesn't work. If it wasn't for Fassbender, it might not have felt a thing. Good performances from James McAvoy, Evan Peters and Jennifer Lawrence as well.", u"I think the movie's biggest problem is, that it has too much going on. It's messy and confusing, jumping from one scene to another without logic. It wasn't as dreadful as Batman vs. Superman, but still not good. It could have been so much more...", u'What bothered me as well was the movie\'s villain. Incredibly cartoonish, stupid and laughably weak. I couldn\'t take him seriously. He was good for a few laugh-out-loud-moments, the rest of the movie it was more like "WTF?!?". Bad, bad villain.', u'On the plus side, the movie was much fun. The action was mixed. Not as loud and awfully long as in Batman vs. Superman, but also not as well dosed as in Captain America: Civil War. The special effects was a mixed bag. There were times when it felt like a video game and other times it was awesome. The pacing was awkward. Most of its troubles are too be blamed both on the directors and writers. ', u'Bottom line: In the end, I would say unless you are a big fan of The X-Men, you should skip seeing this at theaters. It was not bad enough to kill the franchise, but it was disappointing, especially when you can see its possibilities all throughout the movie...
The X-Men movies seem to be cramming too many main characters into the screen time, which seems to take away from the overall plot; and to add on to that 'Apocalypse' isn't nearly as entertaining as 'Days of Future Past.'
Decent characters, true to their comics for the most part to keep the fan boys happy. Some changes but not too bad. A good plot but not as good as previous movies.', u'It was fun.
Good movie with a few suspenseful moments but still your typical X-Men movie.
Lots of apocalypse. Very interesting special effects. Fun to see some folks in action, and got to see how Xavier loses his hair.
best x men to date, behind the wolverine
it could have been better. but I enjoyed it!
I was laughing or smiling nearly the whole time. Has a lot of issues but at least it's fun.
I really wanted this to be worthy of a villain like Apocalypse but it just never delivers.
For any X-Men or comic book fans, this movie will be very satisfying and enjoyable, but it isn't the kind of movie to appeal to all audiences, and I don't think that is a reflection on its quality. The only problems I found were SFX, cliche and borderline annoying villain, needed more with Erik and Quicksilver, and a few character design flaws that just bugged me visually. Other than that, great performances, good script, beautiful score, a lot more Quicksilver(me likey), and an overall enjoyable movie with a rewatchability factor for fans.
The film was largely enjoyable! Other critics have expressed that there were too many side arcs and to a certain extent they are correct and the film could have been trimmed (aka: delete the ENTIRE unnecessary Wolverine portion. They seriously took half an hour just to SHOW him and he contributed absolutely nothing to the story arc), but the other arcs they did do were individually well done and well acted. There were just a few too many of them and could have tied into the larger plot more thoroughly.', u'The Magneto arc in particular was very well done. That actor did a TREMENDOUS job showing the extremes of his character from a peaceful happiness to trauma, to just giving up altogether and you really feel for the guy and can see why (in this movie at least) he would be doing what he does. I also quite thoroughly enjoyed Xavier being in danger and his students rallying to save him... it was quite sweet, and the actor for "young Xavier" always does a good job along with the Magneto actor.', u"Then I have my other usual critiques for this universe: I still don't think Lawrence fits as Mystique (she comes across as young even though the actor is trying hard not to). Nightcrawler is always the best so I'm glad he got more screen time here, and this iteration of Quicksilver has always been a joy to watch.", u"As for the villain--well, he doesn't have any of the boring and repetitive revenge arcs we've seen superhero films focus on lately. He's simplistic and uncomplicated... which would normally be a negative for a villain, but in a movie surrounded by so MANY characters and so many character arcs frankly I'm glad that he didn't further complicate things and instead served as a catalyst for action.", u"So in summary: Enjoyable film, and one I'll purchase to add to my collection! Though it could have definitely benefited from some editing (removing Wolverine/FBI lady altogether and recasting Mystique), but it was a very enjoyable film with some great actors bringing beloved characters to life.
Bryan singer screws up xmen yet again. read the comics. Jesus..
Felt very rushed, but still an ok film.
I loved it, the movie was action-packed. The story-line was consistent & didn't lag. They did a nice job streamlining a few story plots in to the movie.
Great movie on so many levels! Maybe the people that didn't like it were first timers. There have been some poor X-Men movies but this was not one of those. ", u'I can understand critics not liking it but I think more highly of Flixster users!
X-MEN APOCALYPSE WAS CRAZY GOOD AND HAD GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS!!
pudo haber sido mejor
A step down from second film in this series. Many under used characters dot the story, but they all look good at least. Good visuals and another really fun Quicksilver sequence, but the rest never really hits home too hard.
Not the X-Men I grew up with, this is more like an ego exercise for the director. Everything is a mish-mash of crap he read and liked and therefore changed to fit his own needs for the story but its a convoluted mess. We are back to black leather and armor and the horsemen are just chosen because they happen to be there at the time. The movie is competently filmed but little to no love goes into giving us the heroes we all grew up with and there seems to be an embarrassment of the comic costumes which is a big mistake. Why even direct if you cant bring yourself to give us the vision and ambition of the comic books? Because as you put it, color doesnt look good on screen?-How do you explain the last 10 years of comicbook films?! I wish Matthew Vaughn would have directed this and Days of the Future Past.
Even though the plot is a little shaky, it still manages to pull out a very entertaining story and strong characters (yes including Apocalypse)
The last time I watched a movie from the X-Men franchise was in 2009 when I saw X-Men Origins: Wolverine. So I didn't leave this series with the best impression.", u"However, today was a holiday and I had nothing else better to do, so I decided to watch X-Men: Apocalypse. I really wish I'd stuck with my decision to watch Finding Dory instead. This movie was truly one of the most underwhelming films I've seen since Fantastic Four. Granted, this was better, but only by a marginal amount.", u'I\'ll start with the graphics. They were not very good. Not only was CGI overused, but it appeared out-of-place and, dare I say, cheap. I\'ve seen way better. Another problem I have with the visuals are the completely uninspired costume designs. The First Mutant, or "Apocalypse", originates from Ancient Egypt, but wears this generic sci-fi supervillain costume. His Four Horsemen had similarly boring costumes save for Psylocke who wore a racy get-up for absolutely no reason.', u'Speaking of Apocalypse, the entire conflict centering on him was conceptually overdone. An overpowered "god" awakes from a long slumber so that he may once again attempt to take over the world. Yawn. Of course, Apocalypse has very little motivation outside of wanting to establish himself as god on earth. He has zero personality and thus makes for a cardboard villain.', u'His Four "Horsemen" (more like Four Henchmen) are equally as lackluster. Apocalypse goes around the world recruiting downtrodden, broken mutants and taps into their vulnerability to convert them to his cause. Storm is his first victim, soon followed by Psylocke, Angel, and Magneto. They make up his new elite team and they are utterly bland. Storm, starting out as a street urchin trying to survive in the streets of Cairo, is sucked of personality and screentime as soon as she\'s recruited by Apocalypse. I know just as much as I did about Psylocke going into this film, which is to say, nothing at all. Angel, a cagefighter forced to fight for his life, is freed and rendered mute for the remainder of the film. Then there\'s Magneto.', u"Magneto renounces his ways following the events of X-Men: Days of Future Past and supports his newly-formed nuclear family by working in a steel factory in Poland. Spoiler alert: they are typically Fridged (by a FLY-AWAY ARROW!!) and their deaths fuel Magneto's relapse into evil. I thought we were over killing off family members for the sake of triggering plot points, but not this movie. It likes to keep things plain and simple, I suppose.", u"What's worse is that Apocalypse sort of plucks these guys out of nowhere and the majority of them have powers that aren't all that powerful, despite the fact that he somehow makes them stronger by touch. So when their fight scenes finally come up (in the last minutes of the film, mind you), you are left with a gaping sense of dissatisfaction...and confusion. Because, for all Apocalypse's talk of ruling the world through sheer force, his powers are the most disappointing. They are everywhere: he can move earth, he can turn people to dust, he can teleport, he can create shields, and he can tap into Xavier's powers. Throughout the film I desperately tried to pinpoint just what his power was, but I suppose it's meant to be ambiguous. That, or they just couldn't think of anything and decided that he should have a little bit of everything. Needless to say, his final scenes were pitiful.", u"The only things to save this film are every single scene with Rush in it and Jubilee's cute outfit. That's it.", u"I could go on and on about how many unfortunate pitfalls this movie slipped into, but I don't have the patience. Essentially, this movie looks very familiar because it did nothing different. It was painfully reminiscent of literally every Marvel film you have ever watched. You wouldn't be missing anything if you skipped out on X-Men: Apocalypse. Learn from my mistake and save your money for something better.
Critics are idiots. This movie was a prefect close for the fan boys, sort it didn't have universal appeal, but good for Bryan Singer for not being afraid of making a movie directly for the fan the base. If you are a fan of X-Men comics, then you you will love the hell out of this movie. If you are a fan of a good ok blockbuster movies, then no reason not to love it still... Fun movie, looking forward to seeing it again.
Good summer movie but not the best of the series. I always go for Mcavoy and Fassbender but this time the addition of Oscar Isaac was a bonus. They were good but it felt like the First Class Xmen were really just there to pass the torch to the younger x-men. Sometimes it appeared a bit phoned in and I'm not usually a harsh judge of movies, mainly because I have seen some horrible ones. The action was enjoyable but I expected more than that as a fan of all these movies.
Exactly what I expected from the 6th movie in this franchise.
What is everyone complaining about? I am by no means a superhero fan, in fact, aside from Batman and the X-Men, I really don't care, but as someone who has been into X-Men since he was a kid, and seen just about everything, the day it came out, I really can't understand all the bad reviews and the complaints about violence towards women! This film has been called the worst X-Men film ever, nothing is worse than Last Stand, and as far as violence towards woman goes, there has always been fight scenes and there have always been male and female characters involved, in fact, X-Men has always received high praise for included female characters as equals, since the very beginning, so what is it, they aren't allowed to lose a fight? As far as the film goes, the story was terrific, the action sequences and special effects just continue to get better, and the introduction of Cyclopes (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-Mcfee) into the prequel cast just made everything that much better. Without giving anything away, I will say that my one knock on the film would be in the ending. There was so much build-up around the character of Apocalypse and so much talk about how powerful he was. Half the film follows him as he gains power and puts his plan together, but the final battle, that determines the outcome of the film, didn't take very long at all. There was all this hype and build up to this ultimate battle, that could determine the fate of the world, and when it happened, the fans were left scratching their heads by how quickly it ended. Hopefully it was all done with a purpose, and we'll find out why in whatever comes next, but as it stands now, the ending of the film was extremely anti-climatic, besides that, I loved it! Apocalypse might not have been as good as First Class or Days of Future Past, but it certainly wasn't a stinker on the level of Last Stand, the way that most critics portrayed it to be.
A few moments of fun, yeah Quicksilver, completely overshadowed by lazy writings, major plot holes and mediocre performances.
I thought it was a solid movie threw and threw. with these last 3 moives I like the fact that were getting more Beast and Mystique and younger versions of Magneto and Professor X. I also liked Apocalypse he was pretty sweet. I don't know it it was better then the last two Xmen movies but it was right up there. I hope we can get a few more XMen movies the Last 3 have been good. While it does indeed beat Batman vs Superman and yes it was also better then Deadpool Civil War still remains the best Comic book movie of the year
Not bad. Worth seeing but not by much
I'm a sucker for these films
loved it, long live Fox and Marvel collabo
love the x men films
It is a very enjoyable movie, with good graphics and a reasonable plot. Yes, it is hard to come up with something original in terms of the story and CGI, so the overall concept is somewhat similar to other blockbusters we see in the theaters nowadays, still it is a good show worth your time and money. The only negative thing about this one ( a bit of a spoiler here): the time confusion between all previous X-Men, I did get lost in few areas of the story line, trying to figure out, whenever specific character existed in that particular time frame, what skills the character had, and on what side they were at the time - fairly confusing. Otherwise I highly recommend this movie.
Pretty standard super-hero movie story line but great performance by a talented cast
The movie was a lot fun but there were some boring parts like when apacolpce was recruiting the four horseman and pointless part just like when they saw Wolverine it was in there just just to show you wolverine this movie does not have a big impact the big impacts are not that big a guy dies that I did not know he was actually in the movie until I saw the movie and the biggest impact professor X is bald but good parts are the action the characters (quicksilver, mystic,cyclops and professer X) it's just a fun movie it's not a amazing movie
Everything they built will fall', u'With everything going on with the rotten tomatoes score and critical reaction of the film may lead the viewer into not liking the movie. It is not bad, and is far from it. X-Men is the 9th film in the franchise and the 3rd in the first class continuity. Is it the best of the 3? No. But is sure to be a fun ride, with heart and marvelous spectacle.', u'Fassbender and McAvoy are the definitive version of their characters. This continues onto the third installment where Fassbender is as great as ever. There are also solid performances from Isaac and Lawrence in addition to the very fun new cast. The film is very well directed, and has great standalone sequences throughout, which much for every X-men fan to love. One thing that this trilogy has succeeded in is the dynamics between Professor X and Magneto, the trilogy has also succeeded in having emotional heart and genuine feelings, with this one being the most effective. The film also cleverly changes so much about the characters we already know, giving fun spins that are new, creative, and unexpected, taking advantage of a new timeline. Is this movie underrated, that would be a wholehearted yes. ', u'The film is not successful when it comes to the villain or villains. Isaac gives a solid performance, but his plan is over the top, making his motivations cliche and unclear. The four horsemen, or the other three do not have much to do besides look cool, which is disappointing. In fact, some supporting X-men could have been more fleshed out in an extended mall sequence. Though some situations felt convenient there is also a lot of fan service, which may be a good or bad thing depending on the viewer.', u'Overall, those who watch this have to have watched the first two installments to have a full impact on this film. Singed has made a very solid film filled with heart and wonderful protagonist characters.', u'Rating: 7.6 (B)
Amazing. It wowed, touched me emotionally and felt good after watching it.
Lots of good points in the film (Quicksilver's mansion visit was ace!) but not a consistent level throughout. It might be personal bias being a long time X-Men fan having enjoyed Apocalypse as a villain in various guises but here he seemed like an underdeveloped and contradictory character. More of a plot device for other characters than a character himself.
If you expected it to be super true to the comics that's your own stupidity. It's a Singer movie. That being said it was very enjoyable.
Horrible script, horrible casting, horrible movie. The worst in the franchise, and of all recent marvel movies.
It was great. Especially when you realize some of the deeper themes. I think apocalypse looked a bit cheesy, I expected more from his character
X-Men: Apocalypse is not weak at all. On the contrary, it is the most touching of all three, and it's as great as.
I give this movie a 92/-A. A great closer to the First Class trilogy and what a trippy cerebral ending it was.
X-Men: Apocalypse is the third installment in the official reboot of the ever-confusing timeline of the X-Men Franchise, and it's underwhelming. Ensembles in movies are apparently challenging to pull off, and this movie failed to allot sufficient screen time to most of the mutant characters. While still having the flavor of the previous X-Men movies, X-Men: Apocalypse feels like a 2-hour build-up to a quite unsatisfactory final battle.
was deffintitely good. I saw a couple of "odd" things in there that didn\'t add up time-wise with the rest of the franchise... in fact the whole movie doesn\'t add up with regards to time. in the previews you see that pretty much every structure on earth is being decimated and millions probably died. It would have taken decades to rebuild from that and if should have been something that was in the other, older movies. Patrick Stewart as Xavier addresses the president in one of the first movies and it was like they were just now seeing the power of the mutants, but the kind of destruction that was in the previews for this movie would have been on everyones minds still. Dr. Jean Gray is another mystery that doesn\'t add up. When we first meet her, she\'s still not aware of who she is, that\'s solved, sort of, in other movies, but she\'s older. In this movie, it seems like she figures it out and is able to display it... which was really cool by the way.', u'Over all, I did enjoy the movie... there was enough going on that I was feeling a little stressed at times, actually sweating.... so... go see it....
