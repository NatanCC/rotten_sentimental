It's awesome warcraft is finally on big screen. Movie isn't perfect though I enjoyed it very much. 100% recommend everyone to watch it so blizzard will make sequel. There are negative critism on this film but hey this is first film, and story isn't the most crucial of warcraft lore. All is forgiven when story warcraft 3 reign of chaos is much improved film. make that happen blizzard!!
Great to experience this new world on the big screen. I think this is one of those movies that will be even better the second time you watch it.
Fun yet unremarkable film. Filled with shallow characters, top visuals and good action. Get in on bluray.
They did a great job updating the fantasy of the games and bringing it into the cinema. If you liked any part of the series, even the RTS game you will love to movie.
Damn, was not expecting this to be anywhere as good as it was. Amazing cgi and decent human actors carve the way for this years lord of the rings. Definitely big screen worthy even without having played the game it's based on. I'm always partial to a fantasy flick though.
loads of issues, but I had fun.
Warcraft is pretty, the story beats are good, action well made and Duncan Jones does his best to elevate the film, but it's betrayed by some very mixed acting and dialoguem and a story that's so overloaded that sacrifices the emotional aspect for anyone not familiar with the source material (I guess?). It needed to be longer. Better than most game adaptations, but severely flawed.
This was a great start setting the scene for what's to come. The lore and history of warcraft is very extensive and without the proper introduction only avid World of Warcraft players would know what was going on. This was an excellent film with insight into the characters on both sides and not just making out that one side is right and the other evil. It was one of the best Sci-fi fantasy movies I've watched and Iam looking forward to a sequel with anticipation!!
Worst movie of the year. Characters are bland to say the least, badly written, and there is no chemistry between any of them. Script is, I would say nonexistent, and I did grow up on Warcraft 2 and 3, but still I couldn't fallow up on what the hell is going on. And the ending....oh my god the ending makes no sense whatsoever. Also worst CGI I've seen in last ,I don't even know how many years. I remember that Warcraft 3 animations looked better then some characters In this movie...
I wanted to like it. I really did. Warcraft is clearly made with passion for the material, but that's not enough. And while the film makes a sincere effort to 'humanize' the Orcs, by giving them relatable motivations, it all felt too safe and sanitized, to the point that it was hard to care what was happening to anyone. The human characters fared even worse. I was hoping this was another unappreciated gem like John Carter / Edge of Tomorrow / Tomorrowland / Last Witch Hunter, but, no.
It's a generic videogame adaptation that features Game of Thrones music. Or the same composer. It felt like watching a cheap GoT episode.
Surprisingly well developed plot, great graphics and characters that were actually believable. Did not require that you spend the balance of your adolescence I front of the TV playing the video game to understand the storyline.
Easily one of the best movies I've seen in years! ", u"I only started playing WoW a few months ago, and want sure if like this movie much; I mostly went because my wife wanted to. But 'wow' indeed! Beautiful graphics, rich sound (fantastic soundtrack), and solid acting. It never felt too loud or bright, like most JJ Abrams movie do. It kept good pace, yet never felt rushed. Overall it was just a really fun experience!", u'I admittedly know very little about the Warcraft lore. Now, i want to know more! I would love to a sequel of toys very soon.
third grade film of all time....
A good Fantasy movie and the best videogame to movie adaption yet
if you haven't played any of the video games or read the books this movie lacks context. if you have, this movie feels rushed. but keeping in mind the nature of the medium, and within the context of the lore, this movie is a success on every level. I realize that sounds like a lot of caveats, but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
Movie wasn't a bad one, and there was some humor in it, despite some not seeming to catch on to wit and sarcasm. I enjoyed it, and it was based off of a backstory to the game, with some differences. It wasn't so much convoluted as it did require some background in the game. To say you had no sense of where you were, though, I do believe Azeroth (the name of the world) was tossed around in there several times to give you that indication. Also, there was that big map on the ceiling that gave you a visual. Not really sure what you're talking about there. Anyhow, despite the lack of marketing and a scrolling 'this is where we are' backstory, I've seen the movie once in standard and once in 3D. It's worth the watch, and is entertaining.", u"So, most of what I've seen in posts from a lot of people is that they didn't really catch on to what was going on in the movie, and felt like it it was only made for the fans of World of Warcraft. Well, kinda, as most of the advertising was done via the World of Warcraft pages and other Blizzard sites - kind of a big marketing failure, in most regards.", u"So, to clarify, this wasn't a World of Warcraft movie, per se, it was actually, as the title suggests, a throwback to the original RTS game 'Warcraft: Orcs vs. Humans.', of which there were 3, with various expansions of the versions.
Warcraft was cheap trope fantasy that made no sense and its first line establishes it as a prequel for more films that should never be made.
This move is like the game and it is amazing it's so good you should go see it
Although it's been three years since I played the game, the sense of nostalgia was high in this one. Each new zone they entered I tried to place. The reveal of Stormwind and Ironforge was great. I can't say much about the authenticity of the plot as it's been a long long time since I played the originals. The only negative I can say is the real life humans didn't really seem right in the CGI movie. Even the clothing was a bit off. Worth watching and I'd see the sequel.
critic at roton tomatoes are stupid. great movie to watch!!!
The movie remained true and authentic to the games characters, landscapes, races and story for the fans of the games to truly appreciate, while also presenting itself to people who are unfamiliar with the game and allowing them to see, follow and be introduced into the amazing universe Blizzard has created. I look forward to any possible sequels or series in the future!
Dunno what the 'critics' are smoking. But it's definitely not weed. From this point on I won't trust these so-called experts. In the audience, I trust. And rightly so. Sure, there are misgivings here and there, especially with a couple of actors lacking performance prep, like not employing consistent accents with dialogue delivery. I understand if, at the beginning, one might feel slightly lost, as the editing may be a bit jittery at the start. Given all these, they do not deter from keeping you entertained as the visuals, plot and story hold everything up. I personally remembered most of the characters and did have an emotional connection - mostly on Durotan and Lothar (somewhat) through the course. BUT! If you're a hardcore loremonger, you'll hiss at some of the changes. Overall, though, if you're a fan of the fantasy genre, this movie is well worth the watch. If you're a fan of the game, you'll definitely enjoy this movie a whole lot more. Score is 3.5 as I'm a gamer - 3 as a fantasy genre fan. Watch it while you still can.
For all I know this movie may be exactly what Warcraft fans wanted, but for me, as a non-fan, the story just seemed generic, hard to follow, and at times even contrived.
I fell asleep about halfway through (seriously) and it wasn't like I was sleep-deprived going in. This was a big jumbled mess of a movie that probably would have been better as a two-part movie - or even a trilogy - that would have allowed some actual character development. It would have at least given the viewer something to care about.
Too much cgi spoiling this well written script.
one of the worst edited, written movies of all time. if you never played the game you will be lost. DO NOT SEE THIS GARBAGE
I am excited and recall many memories
Fast paced and action packed. Never played the game but still enjoyed the movie. Better than I expected.
If you're not familiar with the Warcraft universe, just be open minded and be prepared for things to happen really fast. Be ready to soak in the few precious slow moments of getting to know the characters and feeling the world. If you're a fan of the games, then nothing need to be said - we've been waiting for this for a long time and now it's here and it's glorious. Enjoy and be proud to be a part of it.
for a low budget movie it was pretty amazing. great plot and great action
Pacing issues but very fun movie. Will definitely be seeing it again.
A great film that was worth the wait. I was not sure about the idea of mixing live action and CGI at first but after seeing the film its hard to tell the difference at any point. Still wish this would have been release in IMAX theaters. I feel it would have made it even more epic.
Relatively decent for a video game adaptation. Acting was decent, story was easy to follow (even for non warcraft fans), but, above all, the CGI was very well done, and beautiful to boot. Not a bad watch at all!
This is definitely a movie for the fans of the lore. It likely helped that I have a copy of The Last Guardian from Blizzcon 2008. There were some great references that set this up to where the game itself launched the first expansion which many of us felt was the peak of the game. The layered references were many, and I can easily see how those who have not been engrossed since Orcs vs Humans could have been left feeling bewildered. Yes, I definitely let my geek and a bit of my age just show there.
as someone who has played wow, I really enjoyed this movie and hope to see sequels.
I enjoyed the movie quite a bit and don't understand all the critic hate. I mean I've played wow and hearthstone a bit but I'm no hardcore can.
Never played the game myself, but entertaining to watch as am into whole fantasy action genre. Good CFI effects and I was hooked on the main theme song by Ramjn Djawadi!! Lol me and movie soundtracks
Awesome movie, I've no idea why it'sgetting bad reviews. I fyou like fantasy genre this movie will please.Excellent seamless blend of CGI and live action. A goody story about honor and learning to get along with others.
A great great movie. Loved every minute. Never played the game.
WARCRAFT doesn't tread into condemnable territory, but it's underdeveloped characters and convoluted conflicts keep an attachment for what's happening on the screen from being formed.
My knowledge of Blizzard\'s Warcraft video game franchise is very limited, but I\'ve always been aware of its style, gameplay, and popularity since it first appeared on the scene. The only installment I\'ve played was "Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness" nearly 20 years ago. I thought it was well made and fun, but had no desire to follow the franchise any further. When MMO RPG "World of Warcraft" launched online back in 2004, the series exploded in greater popularity and changed video games for an entire generation.', u"Of course, these days whenever a preexisting property gains mainstream attention, Hollywood wants to make a movie or better yet a franchise out of it and after many delays, Warcraft is now a big budget blockbuster. Other than Mortal Kombat, Tomb Raider, and Silent Hill (not their sequels), movies based on video games have been poor to say the least. Even my guilty pleasure franchise, Resident Evil, doesn't scream: quality adaptation. So can Warcraft launch a new era of video game movies? Not completely.", u'Warcraft seems to have just as much going against it as it does going for it. The world is vast and interesting, but not thoroughly explored. The characters are colorful and diverse, but not very fleshed out. The story is epic and compelling, but poorly structured and paced.', u'One thing that holds up throughout however is the visuals. Whereas Lord of the Rings had a more realistic gritty style, Warcraft has a vibrant and colorful look that never gets too cartoony. The orcs, animals, and magic effects all look great and gives the film a standout style.', u'The main problem Warcraft has is its lack of narrative depth. Much like "Batman v Superman" earlier this year, Warcraft was clearly butchered in the editing room. Certain story and character arcs feel totally disjointed and rushed because so much material seems to have been cut for time. I felt like I was watching two movies on fast forward. Too much happens too fast and the characters aren\'t given the chance to make a strong connection with the audience outside of a couple of orc warriors. And the casting is questionable to say the least.', u"Warcraft is definitely not a great movie, but it's not a terrible one either. It is worth a look, but don't expect Tolkien-esc quality fantasy. I may not care to ever see another Captain America or Pacific Rim movie, but I'm definitely open to another Warcraft and hopefully things can be improved in future films (IF there will ever be another one).", u'Oh, and the entire final act is RETARDED', u'Score: 5/10
Very enjoyable throughout. Some base knowledge in the game lore helps, but isn't required to enjoy it. Nearly everything in the movie that would possibly confuse people is explained either visually (read: context) or through exposition. The 2 things I was worried about initially was how they would mesh the scenes with orcs and humans together, and that the trailers didn't really show a good sense of the human acting. The movie deals with both of these issues really well, and my previous doubts in those 2 areas were for naught.
I thoroughly enjoyed this show. It wasn't the greatest movie ever but it was interesting and had me wanting to see what happens next. Clearly there's meant to be a part two. I hope it happens.
Can\xb4t cover everything in so little time, but overall the changes were for good and for coherence reasons given that not everything can be explained. Liked it very much.
loved it .. just found it a bit confusing ... old lore
Biased given I played a lot of Warcraft back in the day - hope there is a part 2 and they tie it much closer to the game. Would've love to see Arthas / Frostmourne.
Awesome! Very masterful artwork! Blizzard at its best.
It was a fun movie but this is mainly for hardcore fantasy lovers and fans of the game. You average movie audience will quickly find themselves a little confused by both plot and characters.
A little tough to follow if you never played the game, I kept finding myself wondering, "I wonder if this happened in the game"? Still, aside from some cartoonish magical effects and a couple of really sad scenes, I thought it was a fun flick worth watching and I certainly enjoyed it.
I was really looking forward to this one. It turned out to be a huge CGI mess, with a bad storyline and awful character development.
The critics are way off on this one. Great movie. loved it!
Really enjoyed this movie. Definitely met my expectation.
Played the games, loved the movie.
I very much enjoyed this movie. Though not a hardcore fan in any sense, I have played WoW on and off for many years and I think that is what made this enjoyable. It did not feel like a movie about a specific character but about the history of a world. I can understand feeling lost if you were not had not played the game but it was a fun experience for me.
I liked the movie, I think a big issue with many critics is that many outlets advertised a movie not so much based on the game but the lore and a fresh story even comparing it to a mix of avatar and lord of the rings. But, the movie was based very closely to the MMO, even though the timeline was before World of Warcraft, the timeline did fall within the Warcraft Strategy/RPG games of which World of Warcraft drew its lore and story. I have played the game and I do love fantasy/science fiction, and thought this was good movie, with excellent eye candy, but will agree the acting of the human side, besides Fimmel, who did well, was a bit bland and well, boring.
Some great call outs for the fans, but too much CGI to make the actors playing the humans to feel comfortable. It's a good start, and has made a ton of money globally for a video game movie. But there's a long way to go for this gaming juggernaut to be accepted as solid movie franchise.", u'The "Human" actors all feel out of place. But it\'s that way for all the humans, which is why I point to the tremendous amount of CG set pieces (either that or, dare I say, some less than stellar directing) that tripped them up.', u"Due to the success of this film in China I wouldn't be surprised if the sequel panders to them with Pandarians. Western audiences might just sit this entire video game movie adaption series out while the East (always East ) gets to enjoy a series made just for them.", u'The lore of this universe would be better told with an animated series rather than a big budget movie.', u"The movie was good, but it should not have been what it is. In a time where practical effects are being blended far more seamlessly with CGI this movie comes up short and leaves western audiences wondering why they don't love this movie because they just can't quite figure it out as they get in the car and go home talking about their favorite moments...and how they won't be buying the Blu-ray and will probably hold off seeing the sequel.
This was off the hook....\xf0???
Had a great time watching this movie!
I never got into the game but seeing this film it really peek my interest, it's a very good film one of the best films based on video games in recent years.
Anduin Lothar: Some see death as having some greater purpose, but when it is one of your own, it is hard to grasp anything good comes from it.', u"Video game adaptations usually don't work out too well and Warcraft faces the huge task of trying to bring in a new audience while staying true to its massive following that started out as fantasy MMO that you could play on your computer. Was it too weird and fantastical to get casual viewers to pay and go see? Was this another Lord of The Rings ripoff? These were all fair questions to ask of property that may have not been ready to be adopted to the big screen.
Definitely overstuffed, but more enjoyable than its chaotic trailer would suggest.
With reviews being as bad as they were, I expected it to be bad. It was only half bad. The story seemed rushed and yet they left out so much. There were lots of characters and all of them seemed fairly 1 dimensional. ', u'Overall, it was entertaining but could have been much better.
I was actually impressed on how well this was. I don't play the game but love the fantasy genre. lots of bloody battle action sequences. good story. great motion capture. all around fun summer film.
Better than I thought it was going to be. Cant wait to see the next one.
it was good it looked like it was edited to shorten the movie I want to see the uncut version.
I've played World of Warcraft since 2004, and this movie made me feel like I was visiting Azeroth. All the little nods to the game - the murloc,the Goldshire inn, etc - made me happy as a player, but I don't think the overall plot is inaccessible to someone who hasn't played the game. It's a solid fantasy eye candy movie with excellent CGI effects.
An epic adaptation of the Blizzard's greatest hit, very subtle and family-friendly. You must leave behind any comparison with Lord of the Rings before you watch this movie. Definitely, the best game movie adaptation of all time.
Not good, but better than I thought it'd be. Whatever that's worth.
Many people are going to the movie theaters to get out of the heat. In fact, in L.A. nine people actually went to see the movie "Warcraft." Cohen
I saw the movie with six friends and we all loved the movie. Me and five of my friends play World of Warcraft, one just played Warcraft 3 and another one never played. We dressed up with t-shirts with our characters in the front and our faction in the back (some with horde and others with alliance). It was magical when we found a group of other guys with T-shirts saying horde. I saw the Titanic in cinema and I really didn\'t feel that I wanted to cry but when I saw the Warcraft movie, since the portal was opened to the end with the baby Thrall, I became so emotional. I laughed and I almost cried many times but I have a reputation, so I held my tears (sniff). The look and feel is definitely Warcraft. The action was great with mages that are not afraid to cast a spell. I loved to see the Dark Portal, Stormwind, Ironforge and Dalaran in the movie. I left the cinema with a joy that I never felt with any movie. I enjoyed a lot Lord of the Rings but sorry, after I saw the Warcraft movie I understand that I only enjoyed Lord of the Rings so much because is the most similar movie with the Warcraft Universe. I really loved to see all the easter eggs they put into the movie, the murloc, the sheep, the meeting stone (although there is no dungeon in Elwynn Forest at least in the current time in WOW, we can imagine that in the past it could have existed),.. I usually play PVP in WOW so I don\'t know to much about the Warcraft lore but after I saw the movie I wanted to know more and I started to read the book "Rise of the Horde".', u"Before I saw the movie I read some critic reviews and was afraid of a flop. Some critics compared it to the Dragon Ball Evolution.. and I liked Dragon Ball Z series but come on, the movie is awful. Another critic review that I read is criticizing the fact that the movie point to a sequel and is not a finished movie. Come on ... Do you feel Lord of the Rings is finished after the first movie? What about Star Wars? The Warcraft movie has a main storyline that starts and ends but off course there are more stories to tell and more things to explain. Who is behind the fel? What will happen to Go'el (Thrall)? Who are the blue guys (Draeneis)? So I really don't understand that kind of critics and I just conclude that there are a lot of haters because its a movie about a game and there is a lot of prejudice. But people who know the Warcraft Universe know that there are books besides the great games. Don't listen the critics and go to the cinema and see with your own eyes maybe you have an epic surprise.", u"For me the movie is a 5 stars and I don't want a trilogy.. I want a lot more movies because there are so many and great stories to tell and a trilogy will not be enough.
I liked it but the ending was terrible.
I think the did really well. The special effects were stellar.
Never played Warcraft but I thought this was a good story.
For people who hardly know anything about the lore or the universe, this movie is really not a good idea.
The movie suffers from a rushed pace and a lack of exposition, but I genuinely enjoyed watching it and the orcs were amazing.
It's good, not great. The orcs have more depth than expected. The main villian although ain't a surprise has a bit more background and development than usual for these kinds of movies. The humans are a bit stiff in the beginning, but all in all that's forgivable.", u'Pacing does suck at times, but if you pay attention you can follow the action easy.
As a WoW player I like the movie. It captured the story and the mood of the game well.
If you have ever played any of the Warcraft games, you should enjoy this movie. If not, the story might be a little harder to follow because they are not spending any time doing character development or explaining the Warcraft universe. The world was re-created pretty well, and the orcs are pretty impressive. Magic is very well done. I read some reviews saying the human actors were pretty bad. I did not feel that as I watched the movie but it is true that the actors playing Orcs came out better. Would have been nice to explain more about the reasons some of the character did what they did, but the film was already long to start with. Like Lord of the Rings, it seems that doing a fantasy movie under 2 hours is pretty much impossible. I wish they had chosen to do what Peter Jackson did and go with a longer play time so the story could be more developed. Overall I was very enjoyable despite it's weaknesses.
It was a fun movie, but not a particularly good movie
Refreshing, absolutely awesome, and the first video game movie that is enjoyable for the right reasons.', u'The only complaint would be Khadgar seemed a little too comic-relief, and just dumb sometimes. ', u'I went with friends that had played the games, and some who had not. The ones who had played them, loved it just as much as I did. The ones who had not, still enjoyed it but they did feel like you were just supposed to know the characters.', u'To sum up, Warcraft is intense, has amazing visuals, brilliant acting, and a classic story. Definitely hoping for a sequel.
Great Movie. loved the action and storyline. hope a part 2 comes out
The fight scenes were pretty cool, but I found the entire movie to be a waste of time. Very boring from start to finish.
A great film. Been waiting a very long time for it. Cannot wait to see more sequels to come. The Warcraft universe is huge and deserves a number of movie adaptations to tell the tale. My only criticism is that it was too short. I could've watched easily watched a 3.5 hour long movie on this. And this is coming from someone who is not familiar with the game franchise since WOW arrived.
Not a gamer but this movie was awesome!
I really liked the movie! I didn't expect it to be that good I must say. I don't agree that there is no story in it, on contrary! The story is great and it rides you from the beginning till the end! I didn't even look at the watch, even once! The story, caracters and the effects are totaly satisfying for this kind of movie, even more! My suggestion is to watch the movie!
A bright spot in its genre. It's not LOTR and that's the fun about it.
I was surprised. Had fun with this one. Definitely feels like it was made for the fans (though I've never played Warcraft or WoW).
best movie ever, if you didnt understand it or couldnt follow the story, its because you are a moron, sorry, plain and simple, as the movie is, CGI was great, acting was beatiful, AND THERE WAS A SHEEP, couldnt ask for more
best movie ever, if you didnt understand it or couldnt follow the story, its because you are a moron, sorry, plain and simple, as the movie is, CGI was great, acting was beatiful, AND THERE WAS A SHEEP, couldnt ask for more
Super good and pretty faithful to Warcraft 1. Very fun film that I highly recommend.
Excellent movie. I am so glad I didn't listen to all the (professional movie critics). Me and my son almost didn't go because of all the bad reviews. This movie is very entertaining, eye stunning and all around good. We have never played the game so this is from just a movie goer family. Well worth the money. My son is 11 and he loved it as well. It is entertaining from the first 10 sec. Until the end. I do not know why the critics are reviewing poorly. Go see it. I hope for several more now!
Warcraft \xe9 um filme que n\xe3o consegue se definir entre fic\xe7\xe3o e a\xe7\xe3o. Entrega um filme incompleto em rela\xe7\xe3o a entretenimento, desenvolvimento de personagens e trama. N\xe3o recomendo.
Loved it! I haven't played WOW in years but I may have to start again. The movie was action packed and had just enough humor. I thought the characters brought the World of Warcraft to life. I would definitely recommend to anyone that is into Fantasy/SciFi movies. Can't wait for it to come out on DVD.
A wonderful addition to the X-Men franchise. It included the perfect amount of action, comedy, and story. It introduced many new mutants and incorporated many of them that we had seen in precious X-Men films.
It blows my mind how stupid basically all critics seems to be, both senile and without heart it seems. With a lot of them talking against them self in reviews.', u'Just watch what group of people rating this film the highest, old women.', u'My mother of 64 years could follow the story and liked it.', u'It has a great story, good characters and great effects. Some characters was a little bit bad casted, but not complete misses.', u"And for all critics and people who don't know.", u'The group who would dislike this movie the most is Warcraft fans.', u'If you played the games and know the lore well from them this is a massacre of it.', u'They have changed almost everything in the story. Only the basic story is left, orcs comes through a portal and attacking humans.', u"In the game it wasnt fel magic, Orgrim isn't in frostwolfs, Duraton and Orgrims actions isn't the same, Go'el (Thrall) isn't born there, Durotan and Draka doesn't die that way, Garona isn't Medivh daughter (they are lovers in the game and have a child and pretty much screwes up the guardian story), Garona is not half-orc half-human, Llane is killed by Garona but not like that.", u'I could go on and on.', u'I rate this movie for what it is and try not to get influenced by my previous knowledge of the games and its lore.', u"And it is a great movie. And I think this chapter in the warcraft story is dull one and I hope the next movie will be even better where we will hopefully follow Thrall (Go'el) and the forming of the Horde in Azeroth. With a lot more races, people and beautiful landscapes.
Really enjoyed it. Even more so with a WoW background.
Didn't play the game. Really well down CGI. Story was weak and predictable. Look cool, just a boring animated movie.
It's awesome warcraft is finally on big screen. Movie isn't perfect though I enjoyed it very much. 100% recommend everyone to watch it so blizzard will make sequel. There are negative critism on this film but hey this is first film, and story isn't the most crucial of warcraft lore. All is forgiven when story warcraft 3 reign of chaos is much improved film. make that happen blizzard!!
Great to experience this new world on the big screen. I think this is one of those movies that will be even better the second time you watch it.
