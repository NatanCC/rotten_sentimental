Can't wait until the next movie to come out. Comic nerd !! LOL
Biggest superhero movie up-to-date live up to the hype in every way we can imagine. Too bad we've had so many others before...
The film makes you think it's going to be a formulaic third act but reveals its going to be much more. It juggles so many characters while also being thought provoking and entertaining at the same time. The character work is just amazing. Every character gets a moment, every character shines. The airport fight scene is probably the best fight scene I've seen in years. The story is very well crafted, with amazing action. This is probably the best superhero movie I've ever seen, and I don't know how the Russo Brothers are going to top this (hopefully, they can).
Unlike batman v superman, this movie shows a reason why they are fighting. The Airport battle is AMAZING!
Awesome completion action pact
Best Captain America movie I've seen so far
Spider-man though, soooo funny.
It's very good never wanted it to stop
Best movie in 2016 easily. I wish they focus more on the relationship between Steve Rogers and Bucky more. But the movie still did a great job on why Bucky was so important to Steve. Every Characters in this movie made sense and no one felt like they were there just because they are part of the marvel universe and needs to be there to make people happy. Overall Amazing movie.
God I love this movie in fact this might be the best marvel cinematic universe it was definitely worth the wait the acting is good Spider-Man and black panther stole the the characters were devolved pretty good and I can't wait for black panther movie and Spider-Man homecoming
Not a fan of captain America movies but this one was amazing,spider man was awesome and ant-man too I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of captain America and iron man
I won't ruin it by giving away spoilers but I will say that this was a great comicbook movie! I don't know if its better then the two Avenger movies but its close. The Action was good the plot was good the introduction to Spiderman and Black Panther was very strong. Finally they pick the right person to play Spiderman. As for Black Panther they made him look real strong so that the causal fan will now be very interested in his solo movie which done right could be great. I thought the whole cast worked real hard into making this movie good so if your into comicbook movies and you were disappointed with Batman vs Superman Civil War goes above and beyond to make your forget all about it! One last side note Not only did it crush Batman vs Superman but it also was better then Deadpool as well I know fans might try to say otherwise but its simply not true
Vengeance is a dish best served Marvel!
Great! Managed to fit in a lot gracefully
More of the same, but quality. More of an Avengers movie than a Captain America movie. You might question some of the motives of the characters but you will certainly be amazed by how many stories and feelings the movie is able to cover and capture. No one's story or arc felt half-drawn.
I think this movie is just the best MCU Movie of all time.
This newest install meant to the marvel cinematic universe (MCR)
This is now my favorite movie of all time, nuff said
The Cap movies are the only MCU that are consistently great standing on their own...
The core of the conflict was abandoned 30min in. The director seemed to regret creating too powerful of a being in Vision as his role was reduced to minimal in order to not end the war before the hour. Things did get pulled together somewhat towards the end. An entertaining watch overall.
Good but also just more of the same. All these Marvel movies are blurring into one at the moment.
I'm Not Giving this movie 5 out of 5 stars because one part of the film came out slow, But it got so much better with all those superheroes choosing which team to go on, I Also Love How They Did A First Scene Before Marvel Studios, I Don't Know Why They Do That... But I'm Very Happy i saw this movie, I wanted to see it thinking it will be one of the best superhero movies ever made, And Yes It Is, Even Better than Avengers: Age of Ultron.", u"Everybody go watch this movie because you will all the time you need before walking in the theatres and experiencing a cinematic marvel Amazement, I'm not even kidding you will have fun with this movie, There were a lot of funny moments from spiderman and people thought he is the best character, he is really cool and have damn laughable humour, Don't Miss This One", u'Grade: A-
If people didn't LOVE this, something is wrong with them!! THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES OF ALL TIME!! It's tied for my favourite movie of all time!
Very nicely done! I just disagree with who they chose to play spiderman and disagree that Tony Stark helped spiderman with his suit and all because that did not happen in the comics. The guy that plays spiderman is just too young.
A reminder that Disney\'s "The Avengers" was not a fluke and that every bit matters from the actors, the stories, and the teams behind the cameras. Civil War accomplishes what so many big budget action films don\'t. It intelligently entertains.', u'These characters have motivation and purpose. The script is was written by those who paid attention to what the characters would want to do, and the story is woven deep within that concept. The Disney Move Machine is in top form with obvious love being given to every detail from those behind and in front of the camera.', u'I detailed synopsis is not required. If you have even the slightest interest in this genre you will enjoy it immensely.
Great stuff when it concentrates on the intellectual aspect of the conflict. Maylays at an airport are all "Saturday morning cartoon" fare but the real fight comes toward the end when friends lay into each other over loyalties and nobody is a clear cut winner. Not better than Winter Soldier, but well worth anyone\'s attention. Consummate acting and directing, a big jump from the days of 1990\'s rubber suits and boring villains.
Probably Marvel's finest production. Stellar direction, stellar cast, stellar movie.
EXCELLENT!!! ESPECIALLY IN 3D!!!!
Doy gracias al cielo por haberla visto descargada de internet, mas de lo mismo! Chistes idiotas para ni\xf1os y se cagan en el comic...
This movie lives up to the hype and goes beyond it. This is probably the best Marvel film to date and possibly the greatest comic book movie of all time. The airport scene alone is worth the price of admission. Any worries you had going into this film just forget about them. The only problem that could be had with this film is the main villain's arc but he isn't in the movie enough for it to take you out of the film. I could on and on about how awesome this movie is but I'll just end this by saying.....GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!
One of my least favorite of the amazing Marvel universe movies. Spider-Man cg was awful in the midst of cg that didn't look cg. So most of the cg was amazing then you get an almost Pixar like Spider-Man. I'm still hooked on the Marvel universe and this still progresses the sorry well, but a slight disappointment compared to the rest.
same thing, different sequel.
very enjoyable, I'd see it again
It was okay. 90 % is getting REALLY carried away. I loved CA2 winter soldier btw.
Marvel certainly has their formula down. Though it's one that has become too predictable and boring in my opinion. Also, why the hell didn't they give Vision (a true artificial intelligence that has the ability to bend matter) more lines, more story etc.? He's one, if not THE most intelligent and most powerful character on Earth (if not the galaxy). For the writers and director to have you believe an AI would simply sit in the background not doing anything for the majority of the film is fuckin stupid.
Wow. The movie was greater than I ever had imagined it to be. That character of Vision who is Stark's ally is just such\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0character\xc2\xa0like\xc2\xa0Tony. He really says\xc2\xa0some\xc2\xa0of the most\xc2\xa0outrageous\xc2\xa0things. His humor matches that of Stark's. That is for sure! Downey, Jr. ALWAYS adds his own brand of humor in these Marvel films & I love that about him! Laughter is good- in any sort of a\xc2\xa0movie\xc2\xa0no matter the genre!", u"There really wasn't much of a war\xc2\xa0brewing\xc2\xa0between the characters of\xc2\xa0Captain America and Iron man.\xc2\xa0They\xc2\xa0both did not\xc2\xa0see eye-to-eye on things. The\xc2\xa0same\xc2\xa0situation can occur in life\xc2\xa0today. People will not agree on everything; but it is the tactful way in which to handle things & Captain America\xc2\xa0handled\xc2\xa0them in a\xc2\xa0respectable\xc2\xa0manner fighting for what he wants\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0believes\xc2\xa0was true whereas Iron man just\xc2\xa0wanted\xc2\xa0to fight- literally to stop the Captain.\xc2\xa0And what happened? A War!", u'Someone realized\xc2\xa0their\xc2\xa0mistake and apologized. I will not say who- but once that happened, another secret is\xc2\xa0revealed\xc2\xa0and that\xc2\xa0opened\xc2\xa0up another way between the two, but in\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0end, the same\xc2\xa0things\xc2\xa0happened- someone apologized. In\xc2\xa0life,\xc2\xa0people\xc2\xa0will realize the truths that they are meant\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0realize\xc2\xa0and see.\xc2\xa0You cannot force\xc2\xa0truths\xc2\xa0onto\xc2\xa0people\xc2\xa0who\xc2\xa0are not in the proper mindset to see it when\xc2\xa0you want\xc2\xa0them to see it, but when they choose to see it in\xc2\xa0THEIR\xc2\xa0own\xc2\xa0time. That is what I pulled from the confrontation\xc2\xa0between Steve and Tony during the film.\xc2\xa0I love\xc2\xa0seeing The Black Widow kick butt! Scarlett is one might\xc2\xa0feisty\xc2\xa0bad-ass to put it mildly. I love her\xc2\xa0attitude, her pose, her control,\xc2\xa0her everything! The film had stellar acting, flawless action scenes and there was never a dull moment.\xc2\xa0The\xc2\xa0movie was explosive and that is putting it accurately! Lol! Scarlet Witch really added that "flare" to the film!\xc2\xa0The young actor who portrayed the role of Spider Man was very comical for the short time he was on screen. It was\xc2\xa0just\xc2\xa0hilarious\xc2\xa0to see that and for the character of Aunt\xc2\xa0May played by Tomei; I agree with\xc2\xa0what\xc2\xa0Tony said, his aunt\xc2\xa0is too hot to be an Aunt! Lol! Paul Rudd as Ant-Man added more humor.
Another great marvel movie.
Marvel Studio's does it again, with what I think is probably the best Marvel Film to date. Captain America; Civil War is a hit and jammed packed full of action from start to finish. highly recommended seeing this Movie. Well Done, action nonstop, and tons of Marvel Heros to like.
Stupid... So... So... Stupid.
Amazing movie. Entertaining to the max with a good story, great characters, fun comedy, and unbelievable action. ', u'SPOILERS', u"I really liked how the movie went in directions that I wasn't expecting. After the big battle I thought they were going to make up and be friends again to team up against the other 5 Winter Soldiers. But the bad guy's plan was way better. Restarted the Civil War, and had the movie end with them still apart, setting up future movies", u"it's really amazing that we live in an age where we can have a movie with all these different superheroes in it, and not only does it look real but it's also really good", u"While I was watching it I was wondering who would be on which side, and the only ones I thought I knew where Iron Man and Captain America, but they ended up being on the opposite side of what I thought. But they both made perfect sense. Captain America went through the same stuff with Hydra and SHIELD. It makes sense that he doesn't trust bureaucrats and politicians to make decisions. And Iron Man's side makes sense given past movies and how he feels guilty and responsible for so much stuff. It may not have been addressed a lot in this movie but it has been in previous movies.", u"So many good characters, and I don't just mean awesome superheroes. I mean the actual characters, and their development and archs.", u"I really liked everything about the introduction of Spider-Man including the actor. I am now super excited to see the new movie. And it was reaffirmed to me that Spider-Man is my favorite superhero because I was just so excited to see him, even over all these other awesome superheroes. would have been amazing if I didn't know he was in it. But I didn't know about anyone other than captain, Iron Man, Spider-Man. I was guessing it would have Falcon and War Machine, I didn't know it had everyone else, especially Black Panther and Ant-Man. Black panther is bad-ass and Ant-Man was awesomer and funnier than he was in the entire Ant-Man movie. (4 viewings)
this movie was off the charts awesome i love it
Great in depth story , better action scenes to compliment the already compelling story arc with a few suprising plot twists from about mid-movie towards the final moments of the film . Great post-credit scenes which connect CW (Civil War) to upcoming Marvel movies . There are brief moments when it may seem like the movie has some cheesy humor however ,', u'All in all , a great film to watch especially for those fans of the comic book universe as we see great icons clash together in this epic film . The best Captain America film by far . I personally , watched the entire movie 5 times , the most I have done for any film . Great watch !
My review is skewed by seeing the ratings before hand, so I only saw the good in this movie. But it was quite good, nonetheless (unlike the dark knight rises). Good political plot (almost typical now - heros save the world, world overreacts, heros castrated, bad guys cause problems, heros save the day again). But how each character tied in, was very well co-ordinated. A+ One of the few hero movies that does suck.
8.0 on 10.', u'This is a must see movie for any super hero film fan. Action packed, 2 and a half hours of great distraction. ', u'Not to be missed.', u'Recommended 100
While Batman v. Superman flopped harder than a kid at his first diving lessons, Civil War satisfies superhero movie fans with its action, its wit, and its believable storyline.', u"It would have to take something drastic to split the Avengers. The storyline of Civil War follows Earth's Mightiest Heroes as they are conflicted over whether the Avengers should have to answer to anyone or should be free to intervene whenever they deem necessary. I hate to see heroes fighting against each other, but the Russo brothers make the action so fun and the dialogue so witty that I'm actually left wanting a little more.", u'Civil War is a solid installment in the Avengers franchise, and the Russo brothers have proven themselves to be, for lack of better words, quite awesome at making superhero movies.
Wow! Best Marvel movie of the year so far!! Action packed!!..
I'm very sad to say this movie was disappointing, especially sense my favorite character/actor is in it (Robert). It wasn't very funny, and felt like a repeat of Winter Soldier.
With the Marvel universe expanding so hugely it is very hard to say whether Captain American: Civil War is the best movie released so far, but it is certainly among the top deliveries from the Marvel/Disney's franchise. Darker, raw, action-packed and with the typical glimpses of fresh humor, the third installment of the Captain America spin-off is also a thought provoking movie which somehow partially escapes from the typical Avengers -extravaganza.", u'As it could be expected, after two Avengers movies, Captain America: Civil War is directly related to the whole Marvel-universe. With no extraterrestrial threat to the world the group of super-heroes if focused on fighting secret organizations and villains. Logically, operating around the world soon evokes questions of responsibility and accountability for the whole team. An issue that causes the split of the whole team. Forced to accept obeying to international rules or be considered outlaws, the Avengers have to take hard decisions and that results in Captain America (Chris Evans) refusing to play according to the international rules. Split in two groups, pressured by bureaucracy and fighting an untraceable enemy, the two groups of Avengers are facing the biggest challenge coming from within. ', u"Talking about accountability, we should say that this theme is actually Civil War's biggest asset. Almost everyone among the viewers has wondered at least once in his time watching Marvel movies, to whom are these heroes accountable? To what kind of rules do they have to obey? Who defines what is allowed and what is not? All these thought-provoking questions are carefully asked by directors Anthony & Joe Russo. By depicting the choices each of the Avengers makes, they directing duo explores also the different aspects of the terms responsibility, accountability and checks & balances. This makes Captain America: Civil War a different Marvel movie, one that is darker, more serious and still pleasantly tensed. Needless to say, the humor elements are also part of the story, but this time they are mostly provided by the newcomers in the Avengers univers: Ant-man (Paul Rudd) and Spider-man (Tom Holland). Both of them are refreshingly funny and blend excellently amidst the overall darker tonality. ", u'In conclusion, Captain America: Civil War is probably among the top 5 best movies from the Marvel-Avengers universe. Carefully blending the typical old-school touch of Captain America, with the big and noisy kitsch of The Avengers, this installment explores provoking themes and asks questions which you keep you intrigued and entertained throughout the whole 146 minutes.
a little slow at first, and some plot holes upon review, but still a fun Marvel movie (and way better than all the Thor movies)
This movie was the best movie in the world
Movies from the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise have always been good. Some reached the five-star level (Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy), others just reached 4 1/2 stars. But this superhero landmark film is the next big thing. It's make up everything that Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice got wrong. Captain America: Civil War is not just your typical superhero movie, it's an all new generation of heroes. Civil War is probably not just the best Captain America movie, it's the best MCU movie yet.", u'Taking place after the events or Avengers: Age of Ultron. Steve Rogers/Captain America (Played by the amazing Chris Evans again), is working with his own Avengers team to stop evil doings. But the result leaves with more explosions and casualties. The Secretary of State (William Hurt), and the United Nations think it would be better if the Avengers could help save the world when they want them to help. Rogers disagrees and thinks that the Avengers should be free to defend the world without government interference, but Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr., who will always be the perfect Iron Man), agrees with the Secretary of State. Let the battle begin.', u"Civil War feels like a third Avengers movie, but with no Thor or Hulk to bring more excitement to it. But that's ok. Thanks to the amazing directing of the Russo brothers, Anthony and Joe, who directed the previous installment, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and an amazing story by screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who stayed with the franchise since Captain America: The First Avenger, have brought this movie to life and added some very dramatic depth to it.", u"It's Team Cap Vs Team Iron Man. You pick one. On The Captain's side is the marvelous Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen),the awesome Falcon (Anthony Mackie), the arrow-shooting Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and the hilarious and lovable Ant-Man (a never-better Paul Rudd). On Team Iron Man, he's got help from the beautiful and strong Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), his friend War Machine (Don Cheadle), Vision (Paul Bettany) and our brand new friendly neighborhood Spider-Man (a perfect performance by Tom Holland. Thanks to Holland, Spider-Man in this movie is way better than Andrew Garfield's two Spider-Man movies, but it's not close to topping Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man, yet.", u"We also got a new recruit on Iron Man's team. This hero deserves more praise than some heroes and his name is Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman in his best role to date after 42 and Get on Up), a.k.a T'Challa. T'Challa has a problem with Bucky Barnes/Winter Soldier, (a perfect Sebastian Stan), the Captain's best friend who was brainwashed by the movie's infamous villian Zemo (Daniel Bruhl, who is coming back after his should've been Oscar-nominated performance in Rush). Steve wants Bucky to be free but Tony will stop at nothing to kill Bucky. It's one of the superhero movies you really need to see. ", u"Thanks to the Russo Brothers, Markus, and McFeely, Civil War will remain as MCU's best for a long time. That is until all four of them finish shooting the two-part Avengers: Infinity War movies, which is said to have a total of 68 characters. But until that day comes, Captain America: Civil War will blow people right out of their seats and leaving the theater with something that will stick in their heads for a while. Civil War one of the movies this year that you'll have fun watching.
Marvel outdid themselves.
well this was damn cool except for a few things...killed off some cool people way too fast! Black Panther best character in the whole movie! Antman still awesome! definitely check it out for sure!
Captain America: Civil War handles its stuffed-to-the-limit package superbly, combining excellent writing, thrilling action, and a surprising amount of emotional heft to create a nearly perfect superhero film.
Great film! Marvel and Disney does it again. Top 5 superhero movie of all-time! Amazing fight scenes. Fantastic pacing and arguably the best character balancing of all of the mash-up super hero movies to date. Every character got their time to shine and respective story arc. Excluding, Jeremy Renner's Nighthawk who was obviously there only to fun-fill his contact with Marvel and have an even number on each side for the big battle royal at the airport. They accomplished so much between so many different characters without confusing the audience that it sets the bar a bit higher for future mashup movies.", u'The only reason I give this a 4.5(9/10) is because I still do like care for Bucky as an actor and I do not buy into the relationship him and Captain have. I am not a big Captain fan in the first place and it makes me sad that he is soon to take over the mantle for future films.(Speculation and rumors. Not confirmed) Also, a nice surprise is how enjoyable the black panther character is. I believe he will provide a fresh new feel moving forward considering he is not an American and his abilities are tied to a family lineage which is unique in this cinematic universe so far. This is a must see and if you can make it I encourage you to see it in theater for the full effect.
From the preview, I didn't really expect much from this movie. When I saw it, I absolutely loved it. One of the best MCU this far!
I'll admit, I really wasn't excited for this one. Marvel movies were starting to get overbearing with films like Age of Ultron and Ant-Man (which was at least a fun movie). No, this movie was fun, had a decent plot, and didn't require you to have to read a year's worth of comic books to understand the characters, as well as their morals.
This is easily one of the most well-executed films that successfully balances an incredibly large cast of characters while still giving them each their time to shine and each have their motivation fleshed out.
Another great Marvel to add to the series. What makes this movie great is how it is a genuinely fun time. Many movies now get bogged down in being 'dark' and this movie is able to have its dark moments but still leaves you with the feel good vibes that a comic book movie should. ", u'All the actors deliver spectacular performances in the rolls they have become so accustomed to playing. The two most surprising performances come from Spider-Man (Tom Holland) and Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) as they both deliver two of the funnier sets of dialogue. ', u"There are two post-credit scenes for anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet. These are not too critical to the story, but do give you another smile before you leave the theater.
This was a fantastic movie! Not as good as the first Avengers, but a close second!
Overrall, a very good action-superhero movie, but i cannot give it a perfect 5 stars because i hate the grainy-style that the action scenes are filmed in.
Cap Fights Back! In Civil War This was movie was God!
excellent like always. marvel doesn't disappoints
Was it good? Sure. Good plot, good conflict. Does that mean I want to buy it or watch it again? ...Nope. The film was surprisingly slow for Marvel and a bit melodramatic. I didn't even notice jokes kick in until Spiderman's entrance and while I still have mixed feelings about him being on an Avenger team he brought some semblance of FUN back into the characters (which left again rather quickly when he did).", u'So I appreciate the plot points of the film and the overarching concepts while missing the fun and charisma of these characters.
This Movie is a Home Run. It is Very Fun and I love The Story. There is Also Great Humor. Plus I love the New Spider-Man.', u'5/5
Captain Americ: Civil War is the highest point of Marvel Cinematic Universe, it serves an action packed, a great storyline with a much more conflicts than before, funny, exciting, thrilling, and also full of twist, though it also darker than the first and second one.
92%', u'Boasting an incredible assortment of classic comic book characters, Captain America: Civll War subverts Marvel expectations to deliver a fun, thrilling, and well-earned experience.', u'V: 82%
This Captain America installment ups the hand to hand combat and the humor. Great addition for Marvel movie fans.
Nowhere near as good as Winter Soldier
Dude this movie was great saw it the night it came out 10/10 recommend
the best captain America yet.
Awesome movie. Didn't like the conflict, but that's the story line. It worked.
Demasiado infantil como para llevar ese t\xedtulo, se hubiera titulado "Capitan Am\xe9rica y su Amigo Bucky", le quita toda la seriedad y crudeza de la historia en la que est\xe1 "inspirada". Es entretenida, s\xf3lo eso.
I enjoyed this movie but probably have to watch it again because the girl behind me talked for 3/4 of the movie, I cannot stress this enough "SHUT UP in the movies" so when I finally told her to, that was the end of that. ', u"Anyway, great action and great story, the black panther was great and really hope they do an origin story. I did think that cramming all the heroes in was a little forced and if it seems that way in this cap movie then I can't imagine what the new Avengers is going to feel like. Fun and entertaining!!
Civil War was a very good movie and lived up to the expectations I had for it. If you were disappointed slightly at Age of Ultran, this movie almost makes up for it. It's one of the better super hero movies and it was action packed and well made. A side from a few unanswered questions and a lot of pointless fights, and an interesting ending, I loved nearly every moment of it. It wasn't Marvel's best film, but it was one of the better ones in recent memory.
NEARLY AS GOOD AS AVENGERS ASSEMBLE
Now that was a good superhero movie !! After hating X-Men to my very chore, I needed to reconnect with Marvel. The opening scene is very well filmed and gets you on the edge of your seat. The avengers battle featuring spiderman and antman is perfect and is a pure delight to watch. BlackPanther's character is also very intriguing. The battle between IronMan and Captain America is just a tat too long but hey, why not ?
As always love marvel.... But it should of been named an Avengers movie instead of Captain America.
Very funny...loved it!
another fantastic movie-go see it
Although it's a bit long, the high points are among the highest of the Marvel franchise so far. Just when you think we're sick of the cinematic Spider-Man universe, the character manages to steal the show with a limited amount of screen time. The lack of a strong villain makes the storyline less memorable, but that's kind of the point; if you're seeing this to see the main heroes beat each other up, you shouldn't be disappointed.
It will Be the best marvel movie! Captain america Has fought, And brought damage to citys, of sokovia, New York, Washington DC, He has unlimited power and no supervision, Captain america, Is trying To Save his friend buckey as well.

Wonderful again from Marvel. #TeamIronman
Best marvel movie yet...Avengers 2.5 ! Dialogue great, plot moves along well.
Very good fun movie, plot and villain were weak
Better than most Marvel films. Ultimately, exactly what you'd expect-enjoyable, but not memorable.
one of the best movies this year, not just comic book movies but movies in general. A movie with lots of thrills, drama, action, fast pacing, good editing and the performances are all great, from start to finish and did a mention that Spiderman is in it ??
Loved this movie. An awesome addition to the MCU. Favorite character is Winter Soldier
Fun but the same, again.
I'll be honest guys this movie was just a little too slow for me. I know a lot of people are saying it amazed them when they first saw it but it didn't really amaze me, I didn't really think it was that amazing. It's alright, it was just too slow for me.
Seriously best Movie this year!
Great action, perfect spidey and a incredible movie! The best of MCU
OMG love it sooooo much, spidey is sooooo goood
The action and characters are all pretty cool. However, the story line is sub-par and the villain is bland and uninteresting.
An amazing action pack film!! Watch again and again and again
With Brilliant acting, and superb story, Civil War perfectly begins the next wave of marvel movies and dares to do what Dawn Of Justice could never do
First one is still better
amazing.absolutley amazing
Captain America: Civil War ', u"Captain America and Iron Man come into conflict when a United Nations' ordinance attempting to control the Avengers' activities causes the superhero group to fracture beyond repair. ", u"Loosely based on one of Marvel Comics' most beloved storylines, Captain America: Civil War delivers what was expected: a high octane superhero brawl with a heart. And while CA: CW may not be as intelligent as its predecessor, Winter Soldier, returning director brothers Anthony and Joe Russo manage to sagely balance the iconic characters' personal ideals and perspectives in what amounts to be a difficult family quarrel with extensive consequences. The biggest flaw of this blockbuster film is the deus ex machina like villain...not a bad performance, just not necessary. ", u'Grade: B+', u'Big Al says see Captain America: Civil War in the theatre.
